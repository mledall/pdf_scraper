In particle physics, precision tests for rare phenomena (ﬂavor oscillations and decays, electric
dipole moments etc) are often sensitive to the eﬀects of New Physics (NP) encoded in higher-
dimensional operators with Wilson coeﬃcients given by C/(ΛNP)n, where C is dimensionless, n ≥ 1,
and ΛNP is some energy scale. Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM), predict ΛNP to be at
or greater than the electroweak scale, and the search for NP at ultra-short distance scales is often
stated as the primary goal of precision frontier experiments. In rather general terms, we investigate
the alternative possibility: C (cid:28) 1, and ΛNP (cid:28) mW , to identify classes of precision measurements
that can be induced by light NP (hidden sectors) which require no ultraviolet completion with
additional new states at or above the electroweak scale. We ﬁnd that ﬂavour-diagonal CP violation,
EDMs, lepton ﬂavor violation, as well as lepton g − 2 can be induced at interesting levels by hidden
sectors with light degrees of freedom, while many ﬂavor observables from the hadronic sector, and
precision probes of charged currents typically require new physics with Λ >∼ mW .

INTRODUCTION

Accelerator-based particle physics has the goal of prob-
ing the shortest distance scales directly, by colliding par-
ticles and their constituents at high energies. Thus far,
all existing experimental results at high energy are well
described by the Standard Model (SM) of particles and
ﬁelds, with the last missing element, the Higgs boson,
identiﬁed recently [1, 2]. Attention is now focused on the
search for ‘new physics’ (NP) that would complement the
SM, and address some of its shortcomings. However, the
most prominent empirical evidence for new physics, asso-
ciated for example with neutrino mass and dark matter,
does not always point to a high NP mass scale, leaving
the great dilemma of where it may be hidden.

Fortunately, experiments at the energy frontier are not
the only tools available to probe NP: they are supple-
mented by important searches at the precision (and in-
tensity) frontier (see e.g. [3]). Precision observables, par-
ticularly those that probe violations of exact or approx-
imate symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) such as
CP and ﬂavour, play an important role in the search for
new physics [4–7]. The reach in energy scale, through
the loop-induced corrections of new UV physics to preci-
sion observables can often extend well beyond the direct
reach of high energy colliders. However, measurements
at low energies are sensitive not only to NP corrections
coming from the short distances, but also to NP possibly
located at low energy, with extremely weak coupling to
the SM. It is therefore prudent to question which preci-
sion observables with a measured deviation from the SM
prediction could unambiguously be identiﬁed with short-
distance NP at the electroweak (EW) scale and above, or
if such deviations might also admit an interpretation in
terms of new low-scale hidden sector degrees of freedom.
This is the question we will address in this paper.

The sensitivity of any constraint on new physics is de-
termined on one hand by the precision of the measure-
ment in question, and on the other by the accuracy and

scale vs coupling for physics beyond the SM. The horizontal
axis represents the mass (or energy) scale, whereas the ver-
tical scale shows the visibility of the model, in terms of the
coupling to the SM. The blue visible area is accessible through
direct search experiments. While new high energy physics can
contribute to all precision observables, as discussed in this pa-
per there are interesting classes of observables that are also
sensitive to low mass new physics. These are shown in green,
and include lepton universality (LU), lepton ﬂavour violation
(LFV), lepton g − 2 (MDM), lepton number violation (LNV)
and classes of electric dipole moments (EDMs). However, ob-
servables in the hadronic sector in red, e.g. quark ﬂavour
violation (HFV) and baryon number violation (BNV), gener-
ally require some high scale new physics. The arrows indicate
the pressure imposed on models due to increasing sensitivity

background contributions. If the eﬀective Lagrangian is
schematically written in the form L = LSM + LNP, the
possibility of discovery relies on being able to reliably
bound the NP contribution to the observable away from
zero. The natural tendency to interpret such a result in
terms of LNP induced by ultraviolet NP beyond the SM
energy scales can be problematic, as LNP can in general
also receive contributions from light weakly-coupled NP.
Nothing illustrates this dilemma better than the theo-
retical interpretation of a NP discovery that has already
occurred, namely the observation of neutrino ﬂavor os-
cillations. The experimental results are most straightfor-
wardly interpreted in terms of the masses and mixing of
the light active neutrino species [8, 9]. But, as is well
known, there is a multitude of possible explanations for
their origin. These include a short-distance explanation
in terms of the dimension-ﬁve Weinberg operator [10],
LNP ∝ (HL)(HL)/ΛUV with ΛUV (cid:29) (cid:104)H(cid:105), which gener-
ates neutrino masses scaling as (cid:104)H(cid:105)2/ΛUV. There are also
a variety of diﬀerent UV completions for this operator,
with and without heavy right-handed neutrino states,
that exists throughout the theory literature. While this
interpretation is certainly valid, there is also the possi-
bility of interpreting neutrino mass as a consequence of
very light states mN (cid:28) mW with quantum numbers of
RH neutrinos [11–16]. Such states would typically be
very weakly coupled to SM neutrinos, thus escaping di-
rect detection. The most prominent model in this class
is the simple three-generation extension of the SM by N
states that form Dirac masses for the active neutrinos.
Thus we see that neutrino oscillations can be interpreted
as a result of UV or IR new physics (or both).

In this paper we scrutinize several classes of precision
frontier measurements, and confront them with the possi-
bility of NP conﬁned solely to low energy scales. Our goal
is to ﬁnd speciﬁc examples of light NP that can induce
CP -violation, cause deviations from calculated values of
g − 2, or lead to ﬂavour changing eﬀects. One condition
we set on the classes of such models is the absence of
additional physics at or above the EW scale.
In other
words, we shall focus on UV complete models of light
NP. Given the wealth of particle physics data, only very
speciﬁc classes of light NP models can still be hidden
below the weak scale. In Section 2, we discuss this classi-
ﬁcation of infrared new physics scenarios in more detail.
In section 3, we then discuss a number of diﬀerent lep-
tonic and hadronic observables, and explore simple new
physics scenarios which provide a possible interpretation
of any deviation in precision measurements. We summa-
rize the analysis in Section 4. A schematic overview of
the results is presented in Fig. 1, which illustrates the
classes of (primarily leptonic) observables that can nat-
urally be interpreted in terms of light UV-complete new
physics.

2. UV AND IR NEW PHYSICS

A simple characterization of UV and IR new physics
scenarios follows by making the devision at the elec-
troweak scale, so that the chiral electroweak SU (2)L ×
U (1)Y structure is maintained,

LNP = LUV + LIR.

(1)

New UV physics can then be universally described by a
series of higher dimensional operators constructed from
SM degrees of freedom,

(cid:88)

d≥5

LUV =

Od.

Λd−4

UV

(2)

Maintaining SM gauge invariance explicitly, we demand
that Od can be written in an SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant
form. The lowest dimension d = 5 includes only LHLH-
type operators, which contribute to neutrino mass. The
number of operators grows rapidly at d = 6 and above
[ML:[17]] . We impose no restrictions on these operators,
other than that ΛUV (cid:29) mZ, so that they can consistently
be written in SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant form. Unless
these new operators violate some of the well-tested exact
or approximate discrete symmetries of the SM, ΛUV can
be taken fairly close to the EW scale.
It is important
to notice that the new states appearing at ΛUV could be
charged under any of the SM gauge groups, and some of
the most stringent constraints in cases where no speciﬁc
symmetries are violated now come from the LHC.

In comparison, new IR physics is more constrained. A
convenient categorization of light scenarios can be con-
structed as follows:

A. Portals: Neutral hidden sectors, with operators of
dimension d ≤ 4, can couple through a restricted
set of renormalizable interaction channels, the vec-
tor, Higgs and neutrino portals (see e.g. [18]). Such
models of light new physics are fully UV complete
without any charged states.

B. Anomaly free (neutral): Light hidden sectors can
also be charged under anomaly free combinations of
SM symmetries. For anomaly free symmetries, such
as B − L or Lµ − Lτ that do not involve individual
quark ﬂavours, while additional Higgs ﬁelds may be
necessary to retain a viable mass spectrum. These
additional states can be SM-neutral and so these
scenarios also fall into the category of UV-complete
and gauge-neutral hidden sectors.

C. Anomaly free (charged): Light hidden sectors
charged under anomaly-free, but quark ﬂavour non-
universal, symmetries such Qf1 − Qf2 require new
charged Higgs states to restore the mass spectrum.
Thus, these new physics scenarios generally require
charged states at or above the EW scale.

D. Anomalous: Light hidden sectors charged under
anomalous SM symmetries, such as B or L, nec-
essarily require additional (heavy) charged states
at or above the EW scale, and so again do not fall
into the category of IR new physics scenarios con-
sidered here.
Indeed, as emphasized for example
by Preskill [19], from the low energy perspective,
anomalous theories are phenomenologically analo-
gous to UV new physics scenarios with a speciﬁc
UV cutoﬀ.

Based on this categorization, we will limit our atten-
tion to cases A and B, namely those which do not require
new charged states at or above the EW scale for consis-
tency. Thus we construct our model examples according
to the following rules:

• The dimensionality of operators in the IR sector is
restricted to d ≤ 4, as a necessary condition for UV
completeness.

• The IR sector cannot contain new SM-charged
states. (Otherwise, such states will have to be close
to or above the EW scale modulo some exceptional
cases where masses as low as ∼ 60 GeV may still
be viable [20]). New charged states fall into the
category of NP at the EW scale, and form part of
LUV.
• The gauge extensions of the SM are restricted to
anomaly-free combinations, which is also a generic
requirement of UV completeness [19].

• We shall not question naturalness of possible mass
hierarchies, mIR (cid:28) mW , and will take them as
given.

The simplest type of neutral hidden sector (case A)
requires new scalars Si, neutral fermions Ni and/or new
U (1) gauge boson(s) Aµ [21]. The most economical renor-
malizable portal interactions for these states can be writ-
ten as
LIR = κBµνVµν−H

H(AS+λS2)+YN LHN +Lhid, (3)

†

and can be trivially generalized for multiple new ﬁelds.
Once coupled to the SM, the IR sector can be almost arbi-
trarily complicated. S and N can couple to a more com-
plex hidden sector involving dark abelian or non-abelian
gauge groups, possibly with additional scalar or fermion
states charged under those hidden gauge groups. The full
hidden sector Lagrangian simply needs to comply with
the conditions above. The interactions in (3) assume that
the SM is strictly neutral under the extra U (1), but this
is unnecessarily restrictive. Light NP models (in case B)
may also include non-anomalous global symmetries such
as B− L and Li− Lj etc, where SM ﬁelds receive charges
under the new U (1).

It is also important to discuss some examples of theo-
ries that do not satisfy the above criteria. For example,
a light pseudoscalar a coupled via the axion portal to

a SM fermion ψ, ∂µa/fa × ¯ψγµγ5ψ, clearly requires UV
completion at some high energy scale ∼ fa.
Interest-
ingly, a light scalar directly coupled to the scalar fermion
density, S ¯ψψ, is allowed, provided that this coupling de-
scends from the Higgs portal ASH†H, once the heavy SM
Higgs particle is integrated out. This means, of course,
that the ratio of the eﬀective Yukawa couplings of S to
ψ will obey the same relations as in the SM, and any de-
viations from this pattern would imply the existence of
new Higgs doublets charged under SM, hence some new
physics at or above the EW scale.

We turn in the next section to discuss a range of preci-
sion observables, and seek to classify them into categories
which can receive signiﬁcant contributions from IR new
physics. Table 1 summarizes the results from the next
section, and reﬁnes the schematic classiﬁcation of Fig. 1
according to the categorization of new physics models
A–B introduced above.

3. PRECISION OBSERVABLES

A. Lepton anomalous magnetic moments

The anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and
the muon represent observables where the SM contribu-
tion can be evaluated to high accuracy [ML:[22, 23]] .
For electrons, the sensitivity of NP tests also depends
on an independent determination of the electromagnetic
ﬁne structure constant. Currently, g − 2 of the electron
(and related measurements) probe NP contributions at
the level ∆ae(NP) < 1.64× 10−12 (see e.g. [24]), whereas
g−2 of the muon famously exhibits a ∼ 3.5σ discrepancy
[23] between the measurement and the SM prediction,
with the central value giving ∆aµ (cid:39) +3 × 10−9.

It is tempting to interpret this discrepancy as a con-
sequence of NP that adds a positive contribution to the
predicted SM value. While many UV interpretations ex-
ist (see e.g. [25] ), ∆aµ(NP) can just as easily result from
one-loop contributions of light particles. At the eﬀective
Lagrangian level, both g(cid:48)Vν ¯µγνµ and λ(cid:48)S ¯µµ can supply
the requisite correction if

(4)

This fact is well-appreciated in the literature [26–28].

The vector model can be UV completed via the in-
troduction of a kinetically mixed vector, or alternatively
a symmetry based on gauged muon number, such as
Lµ − Lτ . Dedicated searches for ‘dark photons’ [18] have
now placed signiﬁcant restrictions on the parameter space
of this model. At this point, the kinetically mixed option
for the explanation of ∆aµ (cid:39) 3 × 10−9 is almost entirely
ruled out through direct production experiments assum-
ing that V decays back primarily to SM states [29, 30].
Moreover, the alternative option of vectors decaying to
light dark matter is also signiﬁcantly constrained [31–33].
On the other hand, a model with mutliple (cascading) de-
cays of V into the hidden sector can be ruled out only
via missing energy signatures, and up to now, signiﬁcant
parameter space is still open for ∆aµ ∼ O(10−9). The
Lµ − Lτ explanation is even less constrained, with only
trident neutrino production providing an adequate level
of sensitivity [34, 35]. We conclude that there are mul-
tiple IR models of NP that can lead to the observable
shifts in g − 2, while at the same time escaping direct
detection constraints.

In contrast, models based on scalar particles do not
provide large shifts to ∆aµ. For example, UV completion
via Higgs mixing would imply

as other constraints on the model force A to be much
small, A (cid:28) mh. Thus, larger λ(cid:48) would force additional
NP to appear at the weak scale.

B. Lepton ﬂavour violation and universality

We now turn to leptonic ﬂavour-violating observables.
In analyzing IR new physics scenarios, it will be conve-
nient to have in mind a speciﬁc hidden sector coupled
through the neutrino portal. In particular, to the three
left-handed active neutrinos νl, l = e, µ, τ , we add corre-
sponding right-handed neutrinos NR, plus a number of
extra singlet fermion states NS. Since we are focussing
on light NP, it will prove advantageous to use an inverse
seesaw scheme for neutrino masses [36, 37] rather than
type-I see-saw model,

in the regime  (cid:28) mD, MD. The Dirac mass terms
mD, MD are matrices, but in the simplest example of
only one active ﬂavor, one right-handed neutrino and one
additional singlet, this model predicts one light and two
heavy mass eigenstates, mν, M± respectively given by,

In order to accommodate the
light neutrino mass spectrum, we choose mD (cid:46) MD, and
 (cid:38) mν. To lowest order, the unitary matrix U that
transforms the mass eigenstates into the ﬂavor eigen-
states takes the form,

Because the ν − S and ν − N mixing is so similar, we

We will generally make the assumptions that the ma-
trices MD,  are diagonal and universal, so that they are
characterized by one scale also denoted MD,  respec-
tively (this involves ﬁne tuning, since in general it is
not possible to simultaneously diagonalize both matri-
ces). The visible Dirac masses mD are nearly diagonal,
but not universal, so that mD can be characterized by
three parameters mDe,µ,τ , thus mνl ≈ m2

a. Lepton ﬂavor violation One characteristic lepton
ﬂavour violating (LFV) observable is the µ → eγ de-
cay, whose branching ratio is experimentally constrained
to Br(µ− → e−γ) < 5.7 · 10−13 [38, 39]. The MEG-II
upgrade is expected to have suﬃcient sensitivity to re-
duce this upper bound by about one order of magnitude
[40]. Within the context of the SM, this process proceeds
through a W − ν loop, an example of which is shown in
Fig. 2. Including corrections from the massive neutrinos,
the result is Br(µ → eγ) = (3α/32π)δ2

which ends up being a much tighter constraint on the
mass parameters than the µ → eγ branching ratio. Var-
ious experiments, either running or in planning, project
to reduce the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude
[51, 52].

b. Lepton Universality

It is possible to reﬁne the
mass constraint on the new degrees of freedom, by uti-
lizing tests of lepton universality tests. There exist var-
ious standard decay channels to test lepton universality,
[45, 53, 54].
In particular, we will focus on τ decays,
through the Rτ observable deﬁned as
Γ(τ− → e−νν)
Γ(τ− → µ−νν)

Rτ =

eigenstates and Γ(τ− → e−νν) =(cid:80)

In the SM, because the neutrinos are massless, the ﬂavor
eigenstates νl and mass eigenstates νi coincide so that
Γ(τ− → e−νν) = Γ(τ− → l−ντ νl).
In a general set-
ting though, the masses are linear combinations of ﬂavor
i,j Γ(τ− → l−νiνj).
The Rτ ratio has recently been measured by the BaBar
collaboration, Rτ = 0.9796 ± 0.0016 ± 0.0036 [55], which
we will simply approximate as Rτ ≈ 1 ± ∆Rτ , with
∆Rτ = 0.0052. In general, decay rates have a somewhat
complex dependence on the various lepton and neutrino
masses [56],

simplify the analysis, we split the mN mass range into
5 regions, and take the function f to be equal to 0 or
1 depending on whether the decay channel is allowed.
Using unitarity, it will always be possible to express the
visible-visible mixing in terms of the visible-hidden mix-

assumed Uli = Θl, with Nh the number of hidden ﬂavors.

For this particular light NP model, stronger sensitivity
actually comes from µ − e conversion in nuclei [47–49].
There are two transition channels for this process. First,
the photonic transition, through the same diagram as
the µ → eγ on-shell transition, except the photon is now
connected to the nucleus. The second, through the non-
photonic transition, which occurs either through Z-boson
exchange or a box diagram mediated by W -bosons. It
turns out the non-photonic transition is dominated by
the box diagram. Since we focus on the light neutrino
regime here, we utilize the result that the box diagram
receives a large enhancement in this regime compared to
the photonic transition, i.e. r = Γγ/Γγ ∼ 103 [47], and
the box diagram dominates the µ − e conversion rate.
The conversion rate compared to muon capture in the
nucleus, Rµ−e = Γ(µ − e)/Γcapture, is given by

on meﬀ

tion could instead be due to heavier singlets unrelated to
neutrino oscillations, such as those considered above in
the context of lepton ﬂavor violation.

The nuclear form factor w(p0,|(cid:126)p|) has been approximated
by a step function w ∼ w0Θ(p0 − EF )Θ(|(cid:126)p| − pF ), with
w0 ∼ 4 MeV−1 [64] in terms of the nucleon Fermi mo-
mentum pF ∼ 100 MeV. (A more precise interpolating
formula is given in [65].)

When the dominant contribution is from the light
active neutrinos, the experimental bounds translate to

The above bound is displayed in Fig. 3 for comparison
with the sensitivity from LFV observables. LNV provides
a subleading constraint within this particular inverse see-
saw model, since the lepton number violating parameter
is  which is taken negligible compared to the other mass
parameters. However, more signiﬁcant sensitivity to the
mixing angle arises in the standard seesaw model, where
we enlarge the Majorana terms in the mass matrix. For
example, a recent analysis [65] of the current limits on
the half-lives of 76Ge and 136Xe obtained the constraints
|U 2
eN| < 10−8 − 10−6 as mN varies from 1 − 100 GeV.
These limits are more stringent than those from direct
searches (e.g. from Z decays) for mN > few GeV. That
analysis considers sterile neutrinos whose masses come
predominantly from the Majorana mass term.

the µ− e conversion constraint is by far the strongest, though
the τ → lνν becomes stronger at low .] [ML:Removed text]

plots are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that this simple light
NP model can provide a natural interpretation for devia-
tions observed in µ → e conversion or lepton universality.

ited from the size of the Majorana mass term , which is
set by the constraint on the active neutrino mass squared
diﬀerences. Therefore, within this model it is not possible
to generate a sizeable EDM. However, a far larger EDM
is possible in a variant of this model with an extra visible-
hidden Dirac mass coupling m2. Namely, we switch gear

D. Electric dipole moments

Electric dipole moments (EDMs) provide an important
class of precision CP -odd observables. The only UV-
complete CP -odd mediation channel is via the neutrino
portal, and the phases in the Yukawa matrix YN , pro-
vided there are at least two singlet neutrinos Ni. These
phases can contribute to leptogenesis at high scales and
induce various CP -violating observables, but at a level
that is characteristically suppressed at low energy by the
neutrino masses. We will ﬁrst consider lepton EDMs
induced through this channel before turning to more
generic light NP mechanisms, and then turn to hadronic
EDMs which are distinct as they can be generated at or
close to the current level of sensitivity through the QCD
θ-term.

c. Paramagnetic (and leptonic) EDMs

In the SM
extended with massive neutrinos, it is possible to gener-
ate an EDM at the two-loop level [66–68], an example of
which is shown in Fig. 4. These diagrams can be shown
to scale as

trino mass eigenstates. Up to now, we have ignored the
possible CP -odd phases in this model. However, in gen-
eral not all the mass parameters are real. We choose
to leave the physical CP -odd phase in mD = |mD|eiη,
and for ease of writing, replace |mD| simply with mD.
Given that the mixing angles are mD/MD (cid:46) 0.1, we
see that the contribution from the diagram with two in-
ternal light neutrinos will be tiny, O(mν1mν2∆m2
21).
Thus, we need only look at the cases where either one
or two internal neutrinos are heavy, respectively called
the h − l or h − h contributions. Looking at the h − h
contribution, the mixing that enters is Γ+−, but both
U 2
e+ and U 2
e− have the same phase since they are con-
trolled by mD/MD. The CP -odd phase thus cancels
from the h− h contribution. Next, the h− l contribution

bound to ∼ 10−33e·cm, which is still much lower than the
current experimental upper limit de < 8.7 × 10−29e · cm
[69].

Taking a more general approach, we consider a more
complex light hidden sector. We introduce a Dirac
fermion ψ charged under U (1)V with CP -violating cou-
plings to the scalar singlet S [70–75],

LCP
hid = ¯ψiγµDV

µ ψ + ¯ψ(mψ + S(YS + i ˜YSγ5))ψ.

(27)
µ = ∂µ − e(cid:48)qψVµ. This hidden sector CP -

violation can then be mediated to the SM via the CP -
even vector and Higgs portals.

Loops of ψ can induce the CP -odd hF ˜F vertex shown
in Fig. 5, which contributes to EDMs via Barr-Zee-type
diagrams for example. For simplicity, we assume that V
is parametrically lighter than S and ψ, so the EDM takes
the form (see e.g. [76])

which is still well below the current sensitivity to the
electron EDM [69]. The main constraint, as alluded to
above, is the need to ensure that mV is suﬃciently small
which limits the size of κ < 10−4.

Another contribution to the experimentally accessible
paramagnetic EDMs of atoms and molecules is the semi-
leptonic interaction CS ¯N N eiγ5e. This operator can also
be generated by through the hV ˜V vertex, and allows ac-
cess to a regime with larger mV for which the constraints
on κ are somewhat weaker. However, this contribution is
still not at a level that can approach the current exper-
imental sensitivity. Thus, at least within this restricted
class of hidden sectors, we conclude that paramagnetic
EDMs (and lepton EDMs) are in practice a probe of UV
new physics.

d. Diamagnetic (and hadronic) EDMs Hadronic
EDMs can also be induced using the same mechanism
as outlined above, using the hidden sector Bazz-Zee di-
agram, but as above this will necessarily be below the
current level of sensitivity. However, hadronic EDMs
can also be generated by the QCD θ-term, which is a
marginal operator [77–80]. The strongest current limits
in this sector are from the EDMs of the neutron and from
the Hg atom,

(33)

(34)

where the apparent strength of the Hg EDM bound is
tempered by Schiﬀ screening of the nuclear EDM. The
contribution of ¯θ to the neutron EDM is via the isoscalar
CP -odd pion nucleon coupling ¯g0(¯θ) ∼ 0.05¯θ,

[AR:Numerically, the ﬁnal kinetic mixing required to con-
vert the operator from a V -electric dipole moment to an
EDM is problematic, as it introduces signiﬁcant momen-
tum suppression unless 1/mV is smaller than the char-
acteristic atomic or molecular scale.
In particular, we
require mV < 1/(meαZ), and in this regime there are
strong constraints on κ through the impact of V -loops
on g− 2 of the electron. Inserting qψ = 1, α(cid:48) = α, ˜YS = 1

This leads to the current constraint on ¯θ < 10−10.
The contribution of ¯θ to dHg is more complex, and for
some time it appeared that it would be isospin sup-
pressed as the Schiﬀ moment was primarily sensitive to
¯g1(¯θ) ∼ 0.001¯θ rather than ¯g0(¯θ). However, more recent
analyses of the Hg Schiﬀ moment have indicated that ¯g0
may provide a comparable contribution to ¯g1. Taking the
current ‘best values’ indeed indicates that the dominant
contribution from ¯θ would be through ¯g0, and we have
dHg(¯θ) ∼ 5 × 10

0.05 × 10−10 + O(¯g1(¯θ))

This is a factor of 6 below the current bound, but given
that the precision of the calculation is generally under-
stood to be at the order of magnitude level, it is clear that
a nonzero detection of dHg could not unambiguously be
interpreted as a contribution of a source other than ¯θ.

γVVψγShγ5We conclude that at the current stage, nonzero detec-
tions for the dominant hadronic EDMs observables could
be explained without additional UV new physics, but
simply through new QCD physics in the form of ¯θ. Fur-
ther improvements in the sensitivity to dn could of course
change this picture.

]

E. Quark ﬂavour violation

We now turn to precision quark ﬂavour-violating ob-
servables, with the b → sγ transition as a benchmark.
There are a couple of features which clearly distinguish
these observables, with regard to the role of light new
physics. Firstly, since the RH states are charged, there is
no analogue of the neutrino portal, and thus no renormal-
izable ﬂavour violating interactions that do not involve
new charged states. Given the existing limits on new light
degrees of freedom which are charged, this almost auto-
matically puts quark ﬂavour violating observables into a
category that is sensitive to UV new physics only. The
second distinguishing feature is that the SM generally
provides non-negligible contributions to quark ﬂavour vi-
olation through the CKM matrix. Utilizing a W -boson
loop at leading order for example, the SM contributes to
Br( ¯B → Xsγ) = (3.60±0.30)·10−4 [83], while the BaBar
sensitivity is Br( ¯B → Xsγ) (cid:39) (3.15 ± 0.23) · 10−4 [84].
Thus, the sensitivity to new physics is also determined
by the precision of SM calculations.

Since these observables are not primarily sensitive to
light new physics in the categories that we have delin-
eated, we will not consider them in detail. However, it
is worth outlining how a model with low energy ﬂavour
violation can be realized, albeit one that still relies on ad-
ditional heavy charged states. We will consider a model
in which we gauge an anomaly-free U (1)(cid:48) combination of
quark ﬂavours, Qf 1 − Qf 2 [85, 86], with a diagonal (and
vectorial) gauge coupling of the form [87–90],

(cid:88)

LZ(cid:48) = gzZ

(cid:48)
µ

zf ¯qγµq,

(37)

q=Qf ,uf ,df

with e.g. zQ3 = zb = −zQ2 = −zs = 1. On transforming
to the mass eigenstate basis, this non-universal coupling
will generate a ﬂavour-violating b − s − Z(cid:48) vertex, and
mediate ﬂavour violating transitions.
In practice, this
imposes signiﬁcant constraints on the combinations of
gzzQ,b,s, and is usually used to motivate ﬂavour-universal
U (1)(cid:48) charge assignments. Here, we are interested in hav-
ing a light Z(cid:48) that can indeed mediate these transitions
at the level to which current experiments are sensitive.
If we assign integer charges, then a small gauge coupling
gz ∼ 10−5 will be suﬃcient for this purpose. As has

9
recently been emphasized [86], K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing requires
gz|zQ2 −zQ1| < 10−5MZ(cid:48)/(1 GeV), while B0− ¯B0 mixing
imposes similar constraints on gz|zQ3 − zQ1|. [AR:Better
refs?]

The gauging of ﬂavour-universal symmetries leads to
further model building requirements for the quark mass
spectrum, as the Yukawa matrices are now subject to
additional constraints. Additional charged Higgs ﬁelds
are required, which necessarily lie above the EW scale
given the current LHC constraints. Thus, while quark
ﬂavour-violation could be mediated via a light Z(cid:48), the
model would necessarily involve charged states above the
EW scale, and thus UV new physics.

F. Baryon number violation

New non-SM sources of baryon number violation, for
which the primary precision experiments are searches for
proton decay, necessarily require new UV physics. Since
the minimal baryonic vertex is irrelevant, the most fea-
sible way of introducing a low energy mediation mecha-
nism is to gauge B, introducing a U (1)B vector (see e.g.
[91]). Since B is anomalous, this necessarily requires the
introduction of new charged states, which fall into the
category of new UV physics in our classiﬁcation.

4. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have explored the sensitivity of pre-
cision observables to UV-complete models of light NP.
While it is common to automatically interpret preci-
sion measurements in terms of generic scenarios of new
physics at or above the electroweak scale, we have pointed
out that many of these observables are often most sim-
ply considered within models of weakly-coupled hidden
sectors. More precisely, we ﬁnd that the neutrino portal
allows for a description of many observables in the lep-
tonic sector. Only the observables that intrinsically in-
volve quark ﬂavour violation, baryon number violation,
or changes to the charged currents (and thus electroweak
symmetry breaking) seemingly allow an unambiguous in-
teroperation in term of new short-distance physics.

In particle physics, precision tests for rare phenomena (ﬂavor oscillations and decays, electric
dipole moments etc) are often sensitive to the eﬀects of New Physics (NP) encoded in higher-
dimensional operators with Wilson coeﬃcients given by C/(ΛNP)n, where C is dimensionless, n ≥ 1,
and ΛNP is some energy scale. Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM), predict ΛNP to be at
or greater than the electroweak scale, and the search for NP at ultra-short distance scales is often
stated as the primary goal of precision frontier experiments. In rather general terms, we investigate
the alternative possibility: C (cid:28) 1, and ΛNP (cid:28) mW , to identify classes of precision measurements
that can be induced by light NP (hidden sectors) which require no ultraviolet completion with
additional new states at or above the electroweak scale. We ﬁnd that ﬂavour-diagonal CP violation,
EDMs, lepton ﬂavor violation, as well as lepton g − 2 can be induced at interesting levels by hidden
sectors with light degrees of freedom, while many ﬂavor observables from the hadronic sector, and
precision probes of charged currents typically require new physics with Λ >∼ mW .

INTRODUCTION

Accelerator-based particle physics has the goal of prob-
ing the shortest distance scales directly, by colliding par-
ticles and their constituents at high energies. Thus far,
all existing experimental results at high energy are well
described by the Standard Model (SM) of particles and
ﬁelds, with the last missing element, the Higgs boson,
identiﬁed recently [1, 2]. Attention is now focused on the
search for ‘new physics’ (NP) that would complement the
SM, and address some of its shortcomings. However, the
most prominent empirical evidence for new physics, asso-
ciated for example with neutrino mass and dark matter,
does not always point to a high NP mass scale, leaving
the great dilemma of where it may be hidden.

Fortunately, experiments at the energy frontier are not
the only tools available to probe NP: they are supple-
mented by important searches at the precision (and in-
tensity) frontier (see e.g. [3]). Precision observables, par-
ticularly those that probe violations of exact or approx-
imate symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) such as
CP and ﬂavour, play an important role in the search for
new physics [4–7]. The reach in energy scale, through
the loop-induced corrections of new UV physics to preci-
sion observables can often extend well beyond the direct
reach of high energy colliders. However, measurements
at low energies are sensitive not only to NP corrections
coming from the short distances, but also to NP possibly
located at low energy, with extremely weak coupling to
the SM. It is therefore prudent to question which preci-
sion observables with a measured deviation from the SM
prediction could unambiguously be identiﬁed with short-
distance NP at the electroweak (EW) scale and above, or
if such deviations might also admit an interpretation in
terms of new low-scale hidden sector degrees of freedom.
This is the question we will address in this paper.

The sensitivity of any constraint on new physics is de-
termined on one hand by the precision of the measure-
ment in question, and on the other by the accuracy and

FIG. 1. A schematic view of the parameter space of mass
scale vs coupling for physics beyond the SM. The horizontal
axis represents the mass (or energy) scale, whereas the ver-
tical scale shows the visibility of the model, in terms of the
coupling to the SM. The blue visible area is accessible through
direct search experiments. While new high energy physics can
contribute to all precision observables, as discussed in this pa-
per there are interesting classes of observables that are also
sensitive to low mass new physics. These are shown in green,
and include lepton universality (LU), lepton ﬂavour violation
(LFV), lepton g − 2 (MDM), lepton number violation (LNV)
and classes of electric dipole moments (EDMs). However, ob-
servables in the hadronic sector in red, e.g. quark ﬂavour
violation (HFV) and baryon number violation (BNV), gener-
ally require some high scale new physics. The arrows indicate
the pressure imposed on models due to increasing sensitivity

background contributions. If the eﬀective Lagrangian is
schematically written in the form L = LSM + LNP, the
possibility of discovery relies on being able to reliably
bound the NP contribution to the observable away from
zero. The natural tendency to interpret such a result in
terms of LNP induced by ultraviolet NP beyond the SM
energy scales can be problematic, as LNP can in general
also receive contributions from light weakly-coupled NP.
Nothing illustrates this dilemma better than the theo-
retical interpretation of a NP discovery that has already
occurred, namely the observation of neutrino ﬂavor os-
cillations. The experimental results are most straightfor-
wardly interpreted in terms of the masses and mixing of
the light active neutrino species [8, 9]. But, as is well
known, there is a multitude of possible explanations for
their origin. These include a short-distance explanation
in terms of the dimension-ﬁve Weinberg operator [10],
LNP ∝ (HL)(HL)/ΛUV with ΛUV (cid:29) (cid:104)H(cid:105), which gener-
ates neutrino masses scaling as (cid:104)H(cid:105)2/ΛUV. There are also
a variety of diﬀerent UV completions for this operator,
with and without heavy right-handed neutrino states,
that exists throughout the theory literature. While this
interpretation is certainly valid, there is also the possi-
bility of interpreting neutrino mass as a consequence of
very light states mN (cid:28) mW with quantum numbers of
RH neutrinos [11–16]. Such states would typically be
very weakly coupled to SM neutrinos, thus escaping di-
rect detection. The most prominent model in this class
is the simple three-generation extension of the SM by N
states that form Dirac masses for the active neutrinos.
Thus we see that neutrino oscillations can be interpreted
as a result of UV or IR new physics (or both).

In this paper we scrutinize several classes of precision
frontier measurements, and confront them with the possi-
bility of NP conﬁned solely to low energy scales. Our goal
is to ﬁnd speciﬁc examples of light NP that can induce
CP -violation, cause deviations from calculated values of
g − 2, or lead to ﬂavour changing eﬀects. One condition
we set on the classes of such models is the absence of
additional physics at or above the EW scale.
In other
words, we shall focus on UV complete models of light
NP. Given the wealth of particle physics data, only very
speciﬁc classes of light NP models can still be hidden
below the weak scale. In Section 2, we discuss this classi-
ﬁcation of infrared new physics scenarios in more detail.
In section 3, we then discuss a number of diﬀerent lep-
tonic and hadronic observables, and explore simple new
physics scenarios which provide a possible interpretation
of any deviation in precision measurements. We summa-
rize the analysis in Section 4. A schematic overview of
the results is presented in Fig. 1, which illustrates the
classes of (primarily leptonic) observables that can nat-
urally be interpreted in terms of light UV-complete new
physics.

2. UV AND IR NEW PHYSICS

A simple characterization of UV and IR new physics
scenarios follows by making the devision at the elec-
troweak scale, so that the chiral electroweak SU (2)L ×
U (1)Y structure is maintained,

LNP = LUV + LIR.

(1)

New UV physics can then be universally described by a
series of higher dimensional operators constructed from
SM degrees of freedom,

(cid:88)

d≥5

LUV =

Od.

Λd−4

UV

(2)

Maintaining SM gauge invariance explicitly, we demand
that Od can be written in an SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant
form. The lowest dimension d = 5 includes only LHLH-
type operators, which contribute to neutrino mass. The
number of operators grows rapidly at d = 6 and above
[ML:[17]] . We impose no restrictions on these operators,
other than that ΛUV (cid:29) mZ, so that they can consistently
be written in SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant form. Unless
these new operators violate some of the well-tested exact
or approximate discrete symmetries of the SM, ΛUV can
be taken fairly close to the EW scale.
It is important
to notice that the new states appearing at ΛUV could be
charged under any of the SM gauge groups, and some of
the most stringent constraints in cases where no speciﬁc
symmetries are violated now come from the LHC.

In comparison, new IR physics is more constrained. A
convenient categorization of light scenarios can be con-
structed as follows:

A. Portals: Neutral hidden sectors, with operators of
dimension d ≤ 4, can couple through a restricted
set of renormalizable interaction channels, the vec-
tor, Higgs and neutrino portals (see e.g. [18]). Such
models of light new physics are fully UV complete
without any charged states.

B. Anomaly free (neutral): Light hidden sectors can
also be charged under anomaly free combinations of
SM symmetries. For anomaly free symmetries, such
as B − L or Lµ − Lτ that do not involve individual
quark ﬂavours, while additional Higgs ﬁelds may be
necessary to retain a viable mass spectrum. These
additional states can be SM-neutral and so these
scenarios also fall into the category of UV-complete
and gauge-neutral hidden sectors.

C. Anomaly free (charged): Light hidden sectors
charged under anomaly-free, but quark ﬂavour non-
universal, symmetries such Qf1 − Qf2 require new
charged Higgs states to restore the mass spectrum.
Thus, these new physics scenarios generally require
charged states at or above the EW scale.

D. Anomalous: Light hidden sectors charged under
anomalous SM symmetries, such as B or L, nec-
essarily require additional (heavy) charged states
at or above the EW scale, and so again do not fall
into the category of IR new physics scenarios con-
sidered here.
Indeed, as emphasized for example
by Preskill [19], from the low energy perspective,
anomalous theories are phenomenologically analo-
gous to UV new physics scenarios with a speciﬁc
UV cutoﬀ.

Based on this categorization, we will limit our atten-
tion to cases A and B, namely those which do not require
new charged states at or above the EW scale for consis-
tency. Thus we construct our model examples according
to the following rules:

• The dimensionality of operators in the IR sector is
restricted to d ≤ 4, as a necessary condition for UV
completeness.

• The IR sector cannot contain new SM-charged
states. (Otherwise, such states will have to be close
to or above the EW scale modulo some exceptional
cases where masses as low as ∼ 60 GeV may still
be viable [20]). New charged states fall into the
category of NP at the EW scale, and form part of
LUV.
• The gauge extensions of the SM are restricted to
anomaly-free combinations, which is also a generic
requirement of UV completeness [19].

• We shall not question naturalness of possible mass
hierarchies, mIR (cid:28) mW , and will take them as
given.

The simplest type of neutral hidden sector (case A)
requires new scalars Si, neutral fermions Ni and/or new
U (1) gauge boson(s) Aµ [21]. The most economical renor-
malizable portal interactions for these states can be writ-
ten as
LIR = κBµνVµν−H

H(AS+λS2)+YN LHN +Lhid, (3)

†

and can be trivially generalized for multiple new ﬁelds.
Once coupled to the SM, the IR sector can be almost arbi-
trarily complicated. S and N can couple to a more com-
plex hidden sector involving dark abelian or non-abelian
gauge groups, possibly with additional scalar or fermion
states charged under those hidden gauge groups. The full
hidden sector Lagrangian simply needs to comply with
the conditions above. The interactions in (3) assume that
the SM is strictly neutral under the extra U (1), but this
is unnecessarily restrictive. Light NP models (in case B)
may also include non-anomalous global symmetries such
as B− L and Li− Lj etc, where SM ﬁelds receive charges
under the new U (1).

It is also important to discuss some examples of theo-
ries that do not satisfy the above criteria. For example,
a light pseudoscalar a coupled via the axion portal to

TABLE I. Observables sensitive to the distinct classes of light
new physics models discussed in Section 2.

a SM fermion ψ, ∂µa/fa × ¯ψγµγ5ψ, clearly requires UV
completion at some high energy scale ∼ fa.
Interest-
ingly, a light scalar directly coupled to the scalar fermion
density, S ¯ψψ, is allowed, provided that this coupling de-
scends from the Higgs portal ASH†H, once the heavy SM
Higgs particle is integrated out. This means, of course,
that the ratio of the eﬀective Yukawa couplings of S to
ψ will obey the same relations as in the SM, and any de-
viations from this pattern would imply the existence of
new Higgs doublets charged under SM, hence some new
physics at or above the EW scale.

We turn in the next section to discuss a range of preci-
sion observables, and seek to classify them into categories
which can receive signiﬁcant contributions from IR new
physics. Table 1 summarizes the results from the next
section, and reﬁnes the schematic classiﬁcation of Fig. 1
according to the categorization of new physics models
A–B introduced above.

3. PRECISION OBSERVABLES

A. Lepton anomalous magnetic moments

The anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and
the muon represent observables where the SM contribu-
tion can be evaluated to high accuracy [ML:[22, 23]] .
For electrons, the sensitivity of NP tests also depends
on an independent determination of the electromagnetic
ﬁne structure constant. Currently, g − 2 of the electron
(and related measurements) probe NP contributions at
the level ∆ae(NP) < 1.64× 10−12 (see e.g. [24]), whereas
g−2 of the muon famously exhibits a ∼ 3.5σ discrepancy
[23] between the measurement and the SM prediction,
with the central value giving ∆aµ (cid:39) +3 × 10−9.

It is tempting to interpret this discrepancy as a con-
sequence of NP that adds a positive contribution to the
predicted SM value. While many UV interpretations ex-
ist (see e.g. [25] ), ∆aµ(NP) can just as easily result from
one-loop contributions of light particles. At the eﬀective
Lagrangian level, both g(cid:48)Vν ¯µγνµ and λ(cid:48)S ¯µµ can supply
the requisite correction if

This fact is well-appreciated in the literature [26–28].

The vector model can be UV completed via the in-
troduction of a kinetically mixed vector, or alternatively
a symmetry based on gauged muon number, such as
Lµ − Lτ . Dedicated searches for ‘dark photons’ [18] have
now placed signiﬁcant restrictions on the parameter space
of this model. At this point, the kinetically mixed option
for the explanation of ∆aµ (cid:39) 3 × 10−9 is almost entirely
ruled out through direct production experiments assum-
ing that V decays back primarily to SM states [29, 30].
Moreover, the alternative option of vectors decaying to
light dark matter is also signiﬁcantly constrained [31–33].
On the other hand, a model with mutliple (cascading) de-
cays of V into the hidden sector can be ruled out only
via missing energy signatures, and up to now, signiﬁcant
parameter space is still open for ∆aµ ∼ O(10−9). The
Lµ − Lτ explanation is even less constrained, with only
trident neutrino production providing an adequate level
of sensitivity [34, 35]. We conclude that there are mul-
tiple IR models of NP that can lead to the observable
shifts in g − 2, while at the same time escaping direct
detection constraints.

In contrast, models based on scalar particles do not
provide large shifts to ∆aµ. For example, UV completion
via Higgs mixing would imply

as other constraints on the model force A to be much
small, A (cid:28) mh. Thus, larger λ(cid:48) would force additional
NP to appear at the weak scale.

B. Lepton ﬂavour violation and universality

We now turn to leptonic ﬂavour-violating observables.
In analyzing IR new physics scenarios, it will be conve-
nient to have in mind a speciﬁc hidden sector coupled
through the neutrino portal. In particular, to the three
left-handed active neutrinos νl, l = e, µ, τ , we add corre-
sponding right-handed neutrinos NR, plus a number of
extra singlet fermion states NS. Since we are focussing
on light NP, it will prove advantageous to use an inverse
seesaw scheme for neutrino masses [36, 37] rather than
type-I see-saw model,

in the regime  (cid:28) mD, MD. The Dirac mass terms
mD, MD are matrices, but in the simplest example of
only one active ﬂavor, one right-handed neutrino and one
additional singlet, this model predicts one light and two
heavy mass eigenstates, mν, M± respectively given by,

In order to accommodate the
light neutrino mass spectrum, we choose mD (cid:46) MD, and
 (cid:38) mν. To lowest order, the unitary matrix U that
transforms the mass eigenstates into the ﬂavor eigen-
states takes the form,

Because the ν − S and ν − N mixing is so similar, we
deﬁne the angle Θi ≡ θνiN to characterize the visible-

We will generally make the assumptions that the ma-
trices MD,  are diagonal and universal, so that they are
characterized by one scale also denoted MD,  respec-
tively (this involves ﬁne tuning, since in general it is
not possible to simultaneously diagonalize both matri-
ces). The visible Dirac masses mD are nearly diagonal,
but not universal, so that mD can be characterized by
three parameters mDe,µ,τ , thus mνl ≈ m2

a. Lepton ﬂavor violation One characteristic lepton
ﬂavour violating (LFV) observable is the µ → eγ de-
cay, whose branching ratio is experimentally constrained
to Br(µ− → e−γ) < 5.7 · 10−13 [38, 39]. The MEG-II
upgrade is expected to have suﬃcient sensitivity to re-
duce this upper bound by about one order of magnitude
[40]. Within the context of the SM, this process proceeds
through a W − ν loop, an example of which is shown in
Fig. 2. Including corrections from the massive neutrinos,
the result is Br(µ → eγ) = (3α/32π)δ2

which ends up being a much tighter constraint on the
mass parameters than the µ → eγ branching ratio. Var-
ious experiments, either running or in planning, project
to reduce the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude
[51, 52].

b. Lepton Universality

It is possible to reﬁne the
mass constraint on the new degrees of freedom, by uti-
lizing tests of lepton universality tests. There exist var-
ious standard decay channels to test lepton universality,
[45, 53, 54].
In particular, we will focus on τ decays,
through the Rτ observable deﬁned as
Γ(τ− → e−νν)
Γ(τ− → µ−νν)

Rτ =

eigenstates and Γ(τ− → e−νν) =(cid:80)

In the SM, because the neutrinos are massless, the ﬂavor
eigenstates νl and mass eigenstates νi coincide so that
Γ(τ− → e−νν) = Γ(τ− → l−ντ νl).
In a general set-
ting though, the masses are linear combinations of ﬂavor
i,j Γ(τ− → l−νiνj).
The Rτ ratio has recently been measured by the BaBar
collaboration, Rτ = 0.9796 ± 0.0016 ± 0.0036 [55], which
we will simply approximate as Rτ ≈ 1 ± ∆Rτ , with
∆Rτ = 0.0052. In general, decay rates have a somewhat
complex dependence on the various lepton and neutrino
masses [56],

In this expression, we have ignored small radiative cor-

simplify the analysis, we split the mN mass range into
5 regions, and take the function f to be equal to 0 or
1 depending on whether the decay channel is allowed.
Using unitarity, it will always be possible to express the
visible-visible mixing in terms of the visible-hidden mix-
l , since we
assumed Uli = Θl, with Nh the number of hidden ﬂavors.

In summary, using the neutrino mass diﬀerences to ex-
press Θµ,τ as functions of , Θe, we can present the LFV
and universality constraints above [ML:in the] parameter

For this particular light NP model, stronger sensitivity
actually comes from µ − e conversion in nuclei [47–49].
There are two transition channels for this process. First,
the photonic transition, through the same diagram as
the µ → eγ on-shell transition, except the photon is now
connected to the nucleus. The second, through the non-
photonic transition, which occurs either through Z-boson
exchange or a box diagram mediated by W -bosons. It
turns out the non-photonic transition is dominated by
the box diagram. Since we focus on the light neutrino
regime here, we utilize the result that the box diagram
receives a large enhancement in this regime compared to
the photonic transition, i.e. r = Γγ/Γγ ∼ 103 [47], and
the box diagram dominates the µ − e conversion rate.
The conversion rate compared to muon capture in the
nucleus, Rµ−e = Γ(µ − e)/Γcapture, is given by

normally interpreted directly in terms of the light neu-
trino mass spectrum [62, 63]. Given the existing mass
limits on the light eigenstates, the decay rate depends
on meﬀ
eimi. However, an experimental detec-
tion could instead be due to heavier singlets unrelated to
neutrino oscillations, such as those considered above in
the context of lepton ﬂavor violation.

Utilizing the same neutrino model as in the previous
section, we recall that the heavy mass eigenstates Ni mix
with νe, and we can write the mass eigenstates as Ni =
Ueiνe+··· . It will be suﬃcient to work with the following
analytic approximation for the decay rate [64],

The nuclear form factor w(p0,|(cid:126)p|) has been approximated
by a step function w ∼ w0Θ(p0 − EF )Θ(|(cid:126)p| − pF ), with
w0 ∼ 4 MeV−1 [64] in terms of the nucleon Fermi mo-
mentum pF ∼ 100 MeV. (A more precise interpolating
formula is given in [65].)

When the dominant contribution is from the light
active neutrinos, the experimental bounds translate to
(cid:46) 2eV. Note that when the singlet mass mN (cid:29)

In-

The above bound is displayed in Fig. 3 for comparison
with the sensitivity from LFV observables. LNV provides
a subleading constraint within this particular inverse see-
saw model, since the lepton number violating parameter
is  which is taken negligible compared to the other mass
parameters. However, more signiﬁcant sensitivity to the
mixing angle arises in the standard seesaw model, where
we enlarge the Majorana terms in the mass matrix. For
example, a recent analysis [65] of the current limits on
the half-lives of 76Ge and 136Xe obtained the constraints
|U 2
eN| < 10−8 − 10−6 as mN varies from 1 − 100 GeV.
These limits are more stringent than those from direct
searches (e.g. from Z decays) for mN > few GeV. That
analysis considers sterile neutrinos whose masses come
predominantly from the Majorana mass term.

[ML:The range of MD is bounded above by the requirement
to keep MD < mW , and from below to satisfy the 0νββ con-
straint MD (cid:29) 0.1 GeV. In particular, we note that at large ,
the µ− e conversion constraint is by far the strongest, though
the τ → lνν becomes stronger at low .] [ML:Removed text]

plots are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that this simple light
NP model can provide a natural interpretation for devia-
tions observed in µ → e conversion or lepton universality.

C. Lepton number violation

Neutrinoless double beta decay ββ0ν is the primary ob-
servable for L-violation, and the current limits [57–61] are

ited from the size of the Majorana mass term , which is
set by the constraint on the active neutrino mass squared
diﬀerences. Therefore, within this model it is not possible
to generate a sizeable EDM. However, a far larger EDM
is possible in a variant of this model with an extra visible-
hidden Dirac mass coupling m2. Namely, we switch gear

D. Electric dipole moments

Electric dipole moments (EDMs) provide an important
class of precision CP -odd observables. The only UV-
complete CP -odd mediation channel is via the neutrino
portal, and the phases in the Yukawa matrix YN , pro-
vided there are at least two singlet neutrinos Ni. These
phases can contribute to leptogenesis at high scales and
induce various CP -violating observables, but at a level
that is characteristically suppressed at low energy by the
neutrino masses. We will ﬁrst consider lepton EDMs
induced through this channel before turning to more
generic light NP mechanisms, and then turn to hadronic
EDMs which are distinct as they can be generated at or
close to the current level of sensitivity through the QCD
θ-term.

c. Paramagnetic (and leptonic) EDMs

In the SM
extended with massive neutrinos, it is possible to gener-
ate an EDM at the two-loop level [66–68], an example of
which is shown in Fig. 4. These diagrams can be shown
to scale as

trino mass eigenstates. Up to now, we have ignored the
possible CP -odd phases in this model. However, in gen-
eral not all the mass parameters are real. We choose
to leave the physical CP -odd phase in mD = |mD|eiη,
and for ease of writing, replace |mD| simply with mD.
Given that the mixing angles are mD/MD (cid:46) 0.1, we
see that the contribution from the diagram with two in-
ternal light neutrinos will be tiny, O(mν1mν2∆m2
21).
Thus, we need only look at the cases where either one
or two internal neutrinos are heavy, respectively called
the h − l or h − h contributions. Looking at the h − h
contribution, the mixing that enters is Γ+−, but both
U 2
e+ and U 2
e− have the same phase since they are con-
trolled by mD/MD. The CP -odd phase thus cancels
from the h− h contribution. Next, the h− l contribution

bound to ∼ 10−33e·cm, which is still much lower than the
current experimental upper limit de < 8.7 × 10−29e · cm
[69].

Taking a more general approach, we consider a more
complex light hidden sector. We introduce a Dirac
fermion ψ charged under U (1)V with CP -violating cou-
plings to the scalar singlet S [70–75],

LCP
hid = ¯ψiγµDV

µ ψ + ¯ψ(mψ + S(YS + i ˜YSγ5))ψ.

(27)
µ = ∂µ − e(cid:48)qψVµ. This hidden sector CP -
where DV
violation can then be mediated to the SM via the CP -
even vector and Higgs portals.

Loops of ψ can induce the CP -odd hF ˜F vertex shown
in Fig. 5, which contributes to EDMs via Barr-Zee-type
diagrams for example. For simplicity, we assume that V
is parametrically lighter than S and ψ, so the EDM takes
the form (see e.g. [76])

which is still well below the current sensitivity to the
electron EDM [69]. The main constraint, as alluded to
above, is the need to ensure that mV is suﬃciently small
which limits the size of κ < 10−4.

Another contribution to the experimentally accessible
paramagnetic EDMs of atoms and molecules is the semi-
leptonic interaction CS ¯N N eiγ5e. This operator can also
be generated by through the hV ˜V vertex, and allows ac-
cess to a regime with larger mV for which the constraints
on κ are somewhat weaker. However, this contribution is
still not at a level that can approach the current exper-
imental sensitivity. Thus, at least within this restricted
class of hidden sectors, we conclude that paramagnetic
EDMs (and lepton EDMs) are in practice a probe of UV
new physics.

d. Diamagnetic (and hadronic) EDMs Hadronic
EDMs can also be induced using the same mechanism
as outlined above, using the hidden sector Bazz-Zee di-
agram, but as above this will necessarily be below the
current level of sensitivity. However, hadronic EDMs
can also be generated by the QCD θ-term, which is a
marginal operator [77–80]. The strongest current limits
in this sector are from the EDMs of the neutron and from
the Hg atom,

where the apparent strength of the Hg EDM bound is

[AR:Numerically, the ﬁnal kinetic mixing required to con-
vert the operator from a V -electric dipole moment to an
EDM is problematic, as it introduces signiﬁcant momen-
tum suppression unless 1/mV is smaller than the char-
acteristic atomic or molecular scale.
In particular, we
require mV < 1/(meαZ), and in this regime there are
strong constraints on κ through the impact of V -loops
on g− 2 of the electron. Inserting qψ = 1, α(cid:48) = α, ˜YS = 1

This leads to the current constraint on ¯θ < 10−10.
The contribution of ¯θ to dHg is more complex, and for
some time it appeared that it would be isospin sup-
pressed as the Schiﬀ moment was primarily sensitive to
¯g1(¯θ) ∼ 0.001¯θ rather than ¯g0(¯θ). However, more recent
analyses of the Hg Schiﬀ moment have indicated that ¯g0
may provide a comparable contribution to ¯g1. Taking the
current ‘best values’ indeed indicates that the dominant
contribution from ¯θ would be through ¯g0, and we have
dHg(¯θ) ∼ 5 × 10

This is a factor of 6 below the current bound, but given
that the precision of the calculation is generally under-
stood to be at the order of magnitude level, it is clear that
a nonzero detection of dHg could not unambiguously be
interpreted as a contribution of a source other than ¯θ.

γVVψγShγ5We conclude that at the current stage, nonzero detec-
tions for the dominant hadronic EDMs observables could
be explained without additional UV new physics, but
simply through new QCD physics in the form of ¯θ. Fur-
ther improvements in the sensitivity to dn could of course
change this picture.

E. Quark ﬂavour violation

We now turn to precision quark ﬂavour-violating ob-
servables, with the b → sγ transition as a benchmark.
There are a couple of features which clearly distinguish
these observables, with regard to the role of light new
physics. Firstly, since the RH states are charged, there is
no analogue of the neutrino portal, and thus no renormal-
izable ﬂavour violating interactions that do not involve
new charged states. Given the existing limits on new light
degrees of freedom which are charged, this almost auto-
matically puts quark ﬂavour violating observables into a
category that is sensitive to UV new physics only. The
second distinguishing feature is that the SM generally
provides non-negligible contributions to quark ﬂavour vi-
olation through the CKM matrix. Utilizing a W -boson
loop at leading order for example, the SM contributes to
Br( ¯B → Xsγ) = (3.60±0.30)·10−4 [83], while the BaBar
sensitivity is Br( ¯B → Xsγ) (cid:39) (3.15 ± 0.23) · 10−4 [84].
Thus, the sensitivity to new physics is also determined
by the precision of SM calculations.

Since these observables are not primarily sensitive to
light new physics in the categories that we have delin-
eated, we will not consider them in detail. However, it
is worth outlining how a model with low energy ﬂavour
violation can be realized, albeit one that still relies on ad-
ditional heavy charged states. We will consider a model
in which we gauge an anomaly-free U (1)(cid:48) combination of
quark ﬂavours, Qf 1 − Qf 2 [85, 86], with a diagonal (and
vectorial) gauge coupling of the form [87–90],

(cid:88)

(37)

with e.g. zQ3 = zb = −zQ2 = −zs = 1. On transforming
to the mass eigenstate basis, this non-universal coupling
will generate a ﬂavour-violating b − s − Z(cid:48) vertex, and
mediate ﬂavour violating transitions.
In practice, this
imposes signiﬁcant constraints on the combinations of
gzzQ,b,s, and is usually used to motivate ﬂavour-universal
U (1)(cid:48) charge assignments. Here, we are interested in hav-
ing a light Z(cid:48) that can indeed mediate these transitions
at the level to which current experiments are sensitive.
If we assign integer charges, then a small gauge coupling
gz ∼ 10−5 will be suﬃcient for this purpose. As has

9
recently been emphasized [86], K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing requires
gz|zQ2 −zQ1| < 10−5MZ(cid:48)/(1 GeV), while B0− ¯B0 mixing
imposes similar constraints on gz|zQ3 − zQ1|. [AR:Better
refs?]

The gauging of ﬂavour-universal symmetries leads to
further model building requirements for the quark mass
spectrum, as the Yukawa matrices are now subject to
additional constraints. Additional charged Higgs ﬁelds
are required, which necessarily lie above the EW scale
given the current LHC constraints. Thus, while quark
ﬂavour-violation could be mediated via a light Z(cid:48), the
model would necessarily involve charged states above the
EW scale, and thus UV new physics.

F. Baryon number violation

New non-SM sources of baryon number violation, for
which the primary precision experiments are searches for
proton decay, necessarily require new UV physics. Since
the minimal baryonic vertex is irrelevant, the most fea-
sible way of introducing a low energy mediation mecha-
nism is to gauge B, introducing a U (1)B vector (see e.g.
[91]). Since B is anomalous, this necessarily requires the
introduction of new charged states, which fall into the
category of new UV physics in our classiﬁcation.

4. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have explored the sensitivity of pre-
cision observables to UV-complete models of light NP.
While it is common to automatically interpret preci-
sion measurements in terms of generic scenarios of new
physics at or above the electroweak scale, we have pointed
out that many of these observables are often most sim-
ply considered within models of weakly-coupled hidden
sectors. More precisely, we ﬁnd that the neutrino portal
allows for a description of many observables in the lep-
tonic sector. Only the observables that intrinsically in-
volve quark ﬂavour violation, baryon number violation,
or changes to the charged currents (and thus electroweak
symmetry breaking) seemingly allow an unambiguous in-
teroperation in term of new short-distance physics.

Sensitivity to light weakly-coupled new physics at the precision frontier

In particle physics, precision tests for rare phenomena (ﬂavor oscillations and decays, electric
dipole moments etc) are often sensitive to the eﬀects of New Physics (NP) encoded in higher-
dimensional operators with Wilson coeﬃcients given by C/(ΛNP)n, where C is dimensionless, n ≥ 1,
and ΛNP is some energy scale. Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM), predict ΛNP to be at
or greater than the electroweak scale, and the search for NP at ultra-short distance scales is often
stated as the primary goal of precision frontier experiments. In rather general terms, we investigate
the alternative possibility: C (cid:28) 1, and ΛNP (cid:28) mW , to identify classes of precision measurements
that can be induced by light NP (hidden sectors) which require no ultraviolet completion with
additional new states at or above the electroweak scale. We ﬁnd that ﬂavour-diagonal CP violation,
EDMs, lepton ﬂavor violation, as well as lepton g − 2 can be induced at interesting levels by hidden
sectors with light degrees of freedom, while many ﬂavor observables from the hadronic sector, and
precision probes of charged currents typically require new physics with Λ >∼ mW .

INTRODUCTION

Accelerator-based particle physics has the goal of prob-
ing the shortest distance scales directly, by colliding par-
ticles and their constituents at high energies. Thus far,
all existing experimental results at high energy are well
described by the Standard Model (SM) of particles and
ﬁelds, with the last missing element, the Higgs boson,
identiﬁed recently [1, 2]. Attention is now focused on the
search for ‘new physics’ (NP) that would complement the
SM, and address some of its shortcomings. However, the
most prominent empirical evidence for new physics, asso-
ciated for example with neutrino mass and dark matter,
does not always point to a high NP mass scale, leaving
the great dilemma of where it may be hidden.

Fortunately, experiments at the energy frontier are not
the only tools available to probe NP: they are supple-
mented by important searches at the precision (and in-
tensity) frontier (see e.g. [3]). Precision observables, par-
ticularly those that probe violations of exact or approx-
imate symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) such as
CP and ﬂavour, play an important role in the search for
new physics [4–7]. The reach in energy scale, through
the loop-induced corrections of new UV physics to preci-
sion observables can often extend well beyond the direct
reach of high energy colliders. However, measurements
at low energies are sensitive not only to NP corrections
coming from the short distances, but also to NP possibly
located at low energy, with extremely weak coupling to
the SM. It is therefore prudent to question which preci-
sion observables with a measured deviation from the SM
prediction could unambiguously be identiﬁed with short-
distance NP at the electroweak (EW) scale and above, or
if such deviations might also admit an interpretation in
terms of new low-scale hidden sector degrees of freedom.
This is the question we will address in this paper.

The sensitivity of any constraint on new physics is de-
termined on one hand by the precision of the measure-
ment in question, and on the other by the accuracy and

FIG. 1. A schematic view of the parameter space of mass
scale vs coupling for physics beyond the SM. The horizontal
axis represents the mass (or energy) scale, whereas the ver-
tical scale shows the visibility of the model, in terms of the
coupling to the SM. The blue visible area is accessible through
direct search experiments. While new high energy physics can
contribute to all precision observables, as discussed in this pa-
per there are interesting classes of observables that are also
sensitive to low mass new physics. These are shown in green,
and include lepton universality (LU), lepton ﬂavour violation
(LFV), lepton g − 2 (MDM), lepton number violation (LNV)
and classes of electric dipole moments (EDMs). However, ob-
servables in the hadronic sector in red, e.g. quark ﬂavour
violation (HFV) and baryon number violation (BNV), gener-
ally require some high scale new physics. The arrows indicate
the pressure imposed on models due to increasing sensitivity

background contributions. If the eﬀective Lagrangian is
schematically written in the form L = LSM + LNP, the
possibility of discovery relies on being able to reliably
bound the NP contribution to the observable away from
zero. The natural tendency to interpret such a result in
terms of LNP induced by ultraviolet NP beyond the SM
energy scales can be problematic, as LNP can in general
also receive contributions from light weakly-coupled NP.
Nothing illustrates this dilemma better than the theo-
retical interpretation of a NP discovery that has already
occurred, namely the observation of neutrino ﬂavor os-
cillations. The experimental results are most straightfor-
wardly interpreted in terms of the masses and mixing of
the light active neutrino species [8, 9]. But, as is well
known, there is a multitude of possible explanations for
their origin. These include a short-distance explanation
in terms of the dimension-ﬁve Weinberg operator [10],
LNP ∝ (HL)(HL)/ΛUV with ΛUV (cid:29) (cid:104)H(cid:105), which gener-
ates neutrino masses scaling as (cid:104)H(cid:105)2/ΛUV. There are also
a variety of diﬀerent UV completions for this operator,
with and without heavy right-handed neutrino states,
that exists throughout the theory literature. While this
interpretation is certainly valid, there is also the possi-
bility of interpreting neutrino mass as a consequence of
very light states mN (cid:28) mW with quantum numbers of
RH neutrinos [11–16]. Such states would typically be
very weakly coupled to SM neutrinos, thus escaping di-
rect detection. The most prominent model in this class
is the simple three-generation extension of the SM by N
states that form Dirac masses for the active neutrinos.
Thus we see that neutrino oscillations can be interpreted
as a result of UV or IR new physics (or both).

In this paper we scrutinize several classes of precision
frontier measurements, and confront them with the possi-
bility of NP conﬁned solely to low energy scales. Our goal
is to ﬁnd speciﬁc examples of light NP that can induce
CP -violation, cause deviations from calculated values of
g − 2, or lead to ﬂavour changing eﬀects. One condition
we set on the classes of such models is the absence of
additional physics at or above the EW scale.
In other
words, we shall focus on UV complete models of light
NP. Given the wealth of particle physics data, only very
speciﬁc classes of light NP models can still be hidden
below the weak scale. In Section 2, we discuss this classi-
ﬁcation of infrared new physics scenarios in more detail.
In section 3, we then discuss a number of diﬀerent lep-
tonic and hadronic observables, and explore simple new
physics scenarios which provide a possible interpretation
of any deviation in precision measurements. We summa-
rize the analysis in Section 4. A schematic overview of
the results is presented in Fig. 1, which illustrates the
classes of (primarily leptonic) observables that can nat-
urally be interpreted in terms of light UV-complete new
physics.

2. UV AND IR NEW PHYSICS

A simple characterization of UV and IR new physics
scenarios follows by making the devision at the elec-
troweak scale, so that the chiral electroweak SU (2)L ×
U (1)Y structure is maintained,

LNP = LUV + LIR.

(1)

New UV physics can then be universally described by a
series of higher dimensional operators constructed from
SM degrees of freedom,

(cid:88)

d≥5

LUV =

Od.

Λd−4

UV

(2)

Maintaining SM gauge invariance explicitly, we demand
that Od can be written in an SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant
form. The lowest dimension d = 5 includes only LHLH-
type operators, which contribute to neutrino mass. The
number of operators grows rapidly at d = 6 and above
[ML:[17]] . We impose no restrictions on these operators,
other than that ΛUV (cid:29) mZ, so that they can consistently
be written in SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant form. Unless
these new operators violate some of the well-tested exact
or approximate discrete symmetries of the SM, ΛUV can
be taken fairly close to the EW scale.
It is important
to notice that the new states appearing at ΛUV could be
charged under any of the SM gauge groups, and some of
the most stringent constraints in cases where no speciﬁc
symmetries are violated now come from the LHC.

In comparison, new IR physics is more constrained. A
convenient categorization of light scenarios can be con-
structed as follows:

A. Portals: Neutral hidden sectors, with operators of
dimension d ≤ 4, can couple through a restricted
set of renormalizable interaction channels, the vec-
tor, Higgs and neutrino portals (see e.g. [18]). Such
models of light new physics are fully UV complete
without any charged states.

B. Anomaly free (neutral): Light hidden sectors can
also be charged under anomaly free combinations of
SM symmetries. For anomaly free symmetries, such
as B − L or Lµ − Lτ that do not involve individual
quark ﬂavours, while additional Higgs ﬁelds may be
necessary to retain a viable mass spectrum. These
additional states can be SM-neutral and so these
scenarios also fall into the category of UV-complete
and gauge-neutral hidden sectors.

C. Anomaly free (charged): Light hidden sectors
charged under anomaly-free, but quark ﬂavour non-
universal, symmetries such Qf1 − Qf2 require new
charged Higgs states to restore the mass spectrum.
Thus, these new physics scenarios generally require
charged states at or above the EW scale.

D. Anomalous: Light hidden sectors charged under
anomalous SM symmetries, such as B or L, nec-
essarily require additional (heavy) charged states
at or above the EW scale, and so again do not fall
into the category of IR new physics scenarios con-
sidered here.
Indeed, as emphasized for example
by Preskill [19], from the low energy perspective,
anomalous theories are phenomenologically analo-
gous to UV new physics scenarios with a speciﬁc
UV cutoﬀ.

Based on this categorization, we will limit our atten-
tion to cases A and B, namely those which do not require
new charged states at or above the EW scale for consis-
tency. Thus we construct our model examples according
to the following rules:

• The dimensionality of operators in the IR sector is
restricted to d ≤ 4, as a necessary condition for UV
completeness.

• The IR sector cannot contain new SM-charged
states. (Otherwise, such states will have to be close
to or above the EW scale modulo some exceptional
cases where masses as low as ∼ 60 GeV may still
be viable [20]). New charged states fall into the
category of NP at the EW scale, and form part of
LUV.
• The gauge extensions of the SM are restricted to
anomaly-free combinations, which is also a generic
requirement of UV completeness [19].

• We shall not question naturalness of possible mass
hierarchies, mIR (cid:28) mW , and will take them as
given.

The simplest type of neutral hidden sector (case A)
requires new scalars Si, neutral fermions Ni and/or new
U (1) gauge boson(s) Aµ [21]. The most economical renor-
malizable portal interactions for these states can be writ-
ten as
LIR = κBµνVµν−H

H(AS+λS2)+YN LHN +Lhid, (3)

†

and can be trivially generalized for multiple new ﬁelds.
Once coupled to the SM, the IR sector can be almost arbi-
trarily complicated. S and N can couple to a more com-
plex hidden sector involving dark abelian or non-abelian
gauge groups, possibly with additional scalar or fermion
states charged under those hidden gauge groups. The full
hidden sector Lagrangian simply needs to comply with
the conditions above. The interactions in (3) assume that
the SM is strictly neutral under the extra U (1), but this
is unnecessarily restrictive. Light NP models (in case B)
may also include non-anomalous global symmetries such
as B− L and Li− Lj etc, where SM ﬁelds receive charges
under the new U (1).

It is also important to discuss some examples of theo-
ries that do not satisfy the above criteria. For example,
a light pseudoscalar a coupled via the axion portal to

a SM fermion ψ, ∂µa/fa × ¯ψγµγ5ψ, clearly requires UV
completion at some high energy scale ∼ fa.
Interest-
ingly, a light scalar directly coupled to the scalar fermion
density, S ¯ψψ, is allowed, provided that this coupling de-
scends from the Higgs portal ASH†H, once the heavy SM
Higgs particle is integrated out. This means, of course,
that the ratio of the eﬀective Yukawa couplings of S to
ψ will obey the same relations as in the SM, and any de-
viations from this pattern would imply the existence of
new Higgs doublets charged under SM, hence some new
physics at or above the EW scale.

We turn in the next section to discuss a range of preci-
sion observables, and seek to classify them into categories
which can receive signiﬁcant contributions from IR new
physics. Table 1 summarizes the results from the next
section, and reﬁnes the schematic classiﬁcation of Fig. 1
according to the categorization of new physics models
A–B introduced above.

3. PRECISION OBSERVABLES

A. Lepton anomalous magnetic moments

The anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and
the muon represent observables where the SM contribu-
tion can be evaluated to high accuracy [ML:[22, 23]] .
For electrons, the sensitivity of NP tests also depends
on an independent determination of the electromagnetic
ﬁne structure constant. Currently, g − 2 of the electron
(and related measurements) probe NP contributions at
the level ∆ae(NP) < 1.64× 10−12 (see e.g. [24]), whereas
g−2 of the muon famously exhibits a ∼ 3.5σ discrepancy
[23] between the measurement and the SM prediction,
with the central value giving ∆aµ (cid:39) +3 × 10−9.

It is tempting to interpret this discrepancy as a con-
sequence of NP that adds a positive contribution to the
predicted SM value. While many UV interpretations ex-
ist (see e.g. [25] ), ∆aµ(NP) can just as easily result from
one-loop contributions of light particles. At the eﬀective
Lagrangian level, both g(cid:48)Vν ¯µγνµ and λ(cid:48)S ¯µµ can supply
the requisite correction if

(4)

This fact is well-appreciated in the literature [26–28].

The vector model can be UV completed via the in-
troduction of a kinetically mixed vector, or alternatively
a symmetry based on gauged muon number, such as
Lµ − Lτ . Dedicated searches for ‘dark photons’ [18] have
now placed signiﬁcant restrictions on the parameter space
of this model. At this point, the kinetically mixed option
for the explanation of ∆aµ (cid:39) 3 × 10−9 is almost entirely
ruled out through direct production experiments assum-
ing that V decays back primarily to SM states [29, 30].
Moreover, the alternative option of vectors decaying to
light dark matter is also signiﬁcantly constrained [31–33].
On the other hand, a model with mutliple (cascading) de-
cays of V into the hidden sector can be ruled out only
via missing energy signatures, and up to now, signiﬁcant
parameter space is still open for ∆aµ ∼ O(10−9). The
Lµ − Lτ explanation is even less constrained, with only
trident neutrino production providing an adequate level
of sensitivity [34, 35]. We conclude that there are mul-
tiple IR models of NP that can lead to the observable
shifts in g − 2, while at the same time escaping direct
detection constraints.

In contrast, models based on scalar particles do not
provide large shifts to ∆aµ. For example, UV completion
via Higgs mixing would imply

as other constraints on the model force A to be much
small, A (cid:28) mh. Thus, larger λ(cid:48) would force additional
NP to appear at the weak scale.

B. Lepton ﬂavour violation and universality

We now turn to leptonic ﬂavour-violating observables.
In analyzing IR new physics scenarios, it will be conve-
nient to have in mind a speciﬁc hidden sector coupled
through the neutrino portal. In particular, to the three
left-handed active neutrinos νl, l = e, µ, τ , we add corre-
sponding right-handed neutrinos NR, plus a number of
extra singlet fermion states NS. Since we are focussing
on light NP, it will prove advantageous to use an inverse
seesaw scheme for neutrino masses [36, 37] rather than
type-I see-saw model,

in the regime  (cid:28) mD, MD. The Dirac mass terms
mD, MD are matrices, but in the simplest example of
only one active ﬂavor, one right-handed neutrino and one
additional singlet, this model predicts one light and two
heavy mass eigenstates, mν, M± respectively given by,

In order to accommodate the
light neutrino mass spectrum, we choose mD (cid:46) MD, and
 (cid:38) mν. To lowest order, the unitary matrix U that
transforms the mass eigenstates into the ﬂavor eigen-
states takes the form,

Because the ν − S and ν − N mixing is so similar, we

We will generally make the assumptions that the ma-
trices MD,  are diagonal and universal, so that they are
characterized by one scale also denoted MD,  respec-
tively (this involves ﬁne tuning, since in general it is
not possible to simultaneously diagonalize both matri-
ces). The visible Dirac masses mD are nearly diagonal,
but not universal, so that mD can be characterized by
three parameters mDe,µ,τ , thus mνl ≈ m2

a. Lepton ﬂavor violation One characteristic lepton
ﬂavour violating (LFV) observable is the µ → eγ de-
cay, whose branching ratio is experimentally constrained
to Br(µ− → e−γ) < 5.7 · 10−13 [38, 39]. The MEG-II
upgrade is expected to have suﬃcient sensitivity to re-
duce this upper bound by about one order of magnitude
[40]. Within the context of the SM, this process proceeds
through a W − ν loop, an example of which is shown in
Fig. 2. Including corrections from the massive neutrinos,
the result is Br(µ → eγ) = (3α/32π)δ2

which ends up being a much tighter constraint on the
mass parameters than the µ → eγ branching ratio. Var-
ious experiments, either running or in planning, project
to reduce the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude
[51, 52].

b. Lepton Universality

It is possible to reﬁne the
mass constraint on the new degrees of freedom, by uti-
lizing tests of lepton universality tests. There exist var-
ious standard decay channels to test lepton universality,
[45, 53, 54].
In particular, we will focus on τ decays,
through the Rτ observable deﬁned as
Γ(τ− → e−νν)
Γ(τ− → µ−νν)

Rτ =

eigenstates and Γ(τ− → e−νν) =(cid:80)

In the SM, because the neutrinos are massless, the ﬂavor
eigenstates νl and mass eigenstates νi coincide so that
Γ(τ− → e−νν) = Γ(τ− → l−ντ νl).
In a general set-
ting though, the masses are linear combinations of ﬂavor
i,j Γ(τ− → l−νiνj).
The Rτ ratio has recently been measured by the BaBar
collaboration, Rτ = 0.9796 ± 0.0016 ± 0.0036 [55], which
we will simply approximate as Rτ ≈ 1 ± ∆Rτ , with
∆Rτ = 0.0052. In general, decay rates have a somewhat
complex dependence on the various lepton and neutrino
masses [56],

simplify the analysis, we split the mN mass range into
5 regions, and take the function f to be equal to 0 or
1 depending on whether the decay channel is allowed.
Using unitarity, it will always be possible to express the
visible-visible mixing in terms of the visible-hidden mix-

assumed Uli = Θl, with Nh the number of hidden ﬂavors.

For this particular light NP model, stronger sensitivity
actually comes from µ − e conversion in nuclei [47–49].
There are two transition channels for this process. First,
the photonic transition, through the same diagram as
the µ → eγ on-shell transition, except the photon is now
connected to the nucleus. The second, through the non-
photonic transition, which occurs either through Z-boson
exchange or a box diagram mediated by W -bosons. It
turns out the non-photonic transition is dominated by
the box diagram. Since we focus on the light neutrino
regime here, we utilize the result that the box diagram
receives a large enhancement in this regime compared to
the photonic transition, i.e. r = Γγ/Γγ ∼ 103 [47], and
the box diagram dominates the µ − e conversion rate.
The conversion rate compared to muon capture in the
nucleus, Rµ−e = Γ(µ − e)/Γcapture, is given by

on meﬀ

tion could instead be due to heavier singlets unrelated to
neutrino oscillations, such as those considered above in
the context of lepton ﬂavor violation.

When the dominant contribution is from the light

The above bound is displayed in Fig. 3 for comparison
with the sensitivity from LFV observables. LNV provides
a subleading constraint within this particular inverse see-
saw model, since the lepton number violating parameter
is  which is taken negligible compared to the other mass
parameters. However, more signiﬁcant sensitivity to the
mixing angle arises in the standard seesaw model, where
we enlarge the Majorana terms in the mass matrix. For
example, a recent analysis [65] of the current limits on
the half-lives of 76Ge and 136Xe obtained the constraints
|U 2
eN| < 10−8 − 10−6 as mN varies from 1 − 100 GeV.
These limits are more stringent than those from direct
searches (e.g. from Z decays) for mN > few GeV. That
analysis considers sterile neutrinos whose masses come
predominantly from the Majorana mass term.

the µ− e conversion constraint is by far the strongest, though
the τ → lνν becomes stronger at low .] [ML:Removed text]

plots are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that this simple light
NP model can provide a natural interpretation for devia-
tions observed in µ → e conversion or lepton universality.

ited from the size of the Majorana mass term , which is
set by the constraint on the active neutrino mass squared
diﬀerences. Therefore, within this model it is not possible
to generate a sizeable EDM. However, a far larger EDM
is possible in a variant of this model with an extra visible-
hidden Dirac mass coupling m2. Namely, we switch gear

D. Electric dipole moments

Electric dipole moments (EDMs) provide an important
class of precision CP -odd observables. The only UV-
complete CP -odd mediation channel is via the neutrino
portal, and the phases in the Yukawa matrix YN , pro-
vided there are at least two singlet neutrinos Ni. These
phases can contribute to leptogenesis at high scales and
induce various CP -violating observables, but at a level
that is characteristically suppressed at low energy by the
neutrino masses. We will ﬁrst consider lepton EDMs
induced through this channel before turning to more
generic light NP mechanisms, and then turn to hadronic
EDMs which are distinct as they can be generated at or
close to the current level of sensitivity through the QCD
θ-term.

c. Paramagnetic (and leptonic) EDMs

In the SM
extended with massive neutrinos, it is possible to gener-
ate an EDM at the two-loop level [66–68], an example of
which is shown in Fig. 4. These diagrams can be shown
to scale as

trino mass eigenstates. Up to now, we have ignored the
possible CP -odd phases in this model. However, in gen-
eral not all the mass parameters are real. We choose
to leave the physical CP -odd phase in mD = |mD|eiη,
and for ease of writing, replace |mD| simply with mD.
Given that the mixing angles are mD/MD (cid:46) 0.1, we
see that the contribution from the diagram with two in-
ternal light neutrinos will be tiny, O(mν1mν2∆m2
21).
Thus, we need only look at the cases where either one
or two internal neutrinos are heavy, respectively called
the h − l or h − h contributions. Looking at the h − h
contribution, the mixing that enters is Γ+−, but both
U 2
e+ and U 2
e− have the same phase since they are con-
trolled by mD/MD. The CP -odd phase thus cancels
from the h− h contribution. Next, the h− l contribution

bound to ∼ 10−33e·cm, which is still much lower than the
current experimental upper limit de < 8.7 × 10−29e · cm
[69].

Taking a more general approach, we consider a more
complex light hidden sector. We introduce a Dirac
fermion ψ charged under U (1)V with CP -violating cou-
plings to the scalar singlet S [70–75],

LCP
hid = ¯ψiγµDV

(27)
µ = ∂µ − e(cid:48)qψVµ. This hidden sector CP -

violation can then be mediated to the SM via the CP -
even vector and Higgs portals.

Loops of ψ can induce the CP -odd hF ˜F vertex shown
in Fig. 5, which contributes to EDMs via Barr-Zee-type
diagrams for example. For simplicity, we assume that V
is parametrically lighter than S and ψ, so the EDM takes
the form (see e.g. [76])

which is still well below the current sensitivity to the
electron EDM [69]. The main constraint, as alluded to
above, is the need to ensure that mV is suﬃciently small
which limits the size of κ < 10−4.

Another contribution to the experimentally accessible
paramagnetic EDMs of atoms and molecules is the semi-
leptonic interaction CS ¯N N eiγ5e. This operator can also
be generated by through the hV ˜V vertex, and allows ac-
cess to a regime with larger mV for which the constraints
on κ are somewhat weaker. However, this contribution is
still not at a level that can approach the current exper-
imental sensitivity. Thus, at least within this restricted
class of hidden sectors, we conclude that paramagnetic
EDMs (and lepton EDMs) are in practice a probe of UV
new physics.

d. Diamagnetic (and hadronic) EDMs Hadronic
EDMs can also be induced using the same mechanism
as outlined above, using the hidden sector Bazz-Zee di-
agram, but as above this will necessarily be below the
current level of sensitivity. However, hadronic EDMs
can also be generated by the QCD θ-term, which is a
marginal operator [77–80]. The strongest current limits
in this sector are from the EDMs of the neutron and from
the Hg atom,

(33)

(34)

where the apparent strength of the Hg EDM bound is
tempered by Schiﬀ screening of the nuclear EDM. The
contribution of ¯θ to the neutron EDM is via the isoscalar
CP -odd pion nucleon coupling ¯g0(¯θ) ∼ 0.05¯θ,

[AR:Numerically, the ﬁnal kinetic mixing required to con-
vert the operator from a V -electric dipole moment to an
EDM is problematic, as it introduces signiﬁcant momen-
tum suppression unless 1/mV is smaller than the char-
acteristic atomic or molecular scale.
In particular, we
require mV < 1/(meαZ), and in this regime there are
strong constraints on κ through the impact of V -loops
on g− 2 of the electron. Inserting qψ = 1, α(cid:48) = α, ˜YS = 1

This leads to the current constraint on ¯θ < 10−10.
The contribution of ¯θ to dHg is more complex, and for
some time it appeared that it would be isospin sup-
pressed as the Schiﬀ moment was primarily sensitive to
¯g1(¯θ) ∼ 0.001¯θ rather than ¯g0(¯θ). However, more recent
analyses of the Hg Schiﬀ moment have indicated that ¯g0
may provide a comparable contribution to ¯g1. Taking the
current ‘best values’ indeed indicates that the dominant
contribution from ¯θ would be through ¯g0, and we have
dHg(¯θ) ∼ 5 × 10

0.05 × 10−10 + O(¯g1(¯θ))

This is a factor of 6 below the current bound, but given
that the precision of the calculation is generally under-
stood to be at the order of magnitude level, it is clear that
a nonzero detection of dHg could not unambiguously be
interpreted as a contribution of a source other than ¯θ.

γVVψγShγ5We conclude that at the current stage, nonzero detec-
tions for the dominant hadronic EDMs observables could
be explained without additional UV new physics, but
simply through new QCD physics in the form of ¯θ. Fur-
ther improvements in the sensitivity to dn could of course
change this picture.

]

E. Quark ﬂavour violation

We now turn to precision quark ﬂavour-violating ob-
servables, with the b → sγ transition as a benchmark.
There are a couple of features which clearly distinguish
these observables, with regard to the role of light new
physics. Firstly, since the RH states are charged, there is
no analogue of the neutrino portal, and thus no renormal-
izable ﬂavour violating interactions that do not involve
new charged states. Given the existing limits on new light
degrees of freedom which are charged, this almost auto-
matically puts quark ﬂavour violating observables into a
category that is sensitive to UV new physics only. The
second distinguishing feature is that the SM generally
provides non-negligible contributions to quark ﬂavour vi-
olation through the CKM matrix. Utilizing a W -boson
loop at leading order for example, the SM contributes to
Br( ¯B → Xsγ) = (3.60±0.30)·10−4 [83], while the BaBar
sensitivity is Br( ¯B → Xsγ) (cid:39) (3.15 ± 0.23) · 10−4 [84].
Thus, the sensitivity to new physics is also determined
by the precision of SM calculations.

Since these observables are not primarily sensitive to
light new physics in the categories that we have delin-
eated, we will not consider them in detail. However, it
is worth outlining how a model with low energy ﬂavour
violation can be realized, albeit one that still relies on ad-
ditional heavy charged states. We will consider a model
in which we gauge an anomaly-free U (1)(cid:48) combination of
quark ﬂavours, Qf 1 − Qf 2 [85, 86], with a diagonal (and
vectorial) gauge coupling of the form [87–90],

(cid:88)

LZ(cid:48) = gzZ

(cid:48)
µ

zf ¯qγµq,

(37)

q=Qf ,uf ,df

with e.g. zQ3 = zb = −zQ2 = −zs = 1. On transforming
to the mass eigenstate basis, this non-universal coupling
will generate a ﬂavour-violating b − s − Z(cid:48) vertex, and
mediate ﬂavour violating transitions.
In practice, this
imposes signiﬁcant constraints on the combinations of
gzzQ,b,s, and is usually used to motivate ﬂavour-universal
U (1)(cid:48) charge assignments. Here, we are interested in hav-
ing a light Z(cid:48) that can indeed mediate these transitions
at the level to which current experiments are sensitive.
If we assign integer charges, then a small gauge coupling
gz ∼ 10−5 will be suﬃcient for this purpose. As has

9
recently been emphasized [86], K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing requires
gz|zQ2 −zQ1| < 10−5MZ(cid:48)/(1 GeV), while B0− ¯B0 mixing
imposes similar constraints on gz|zQ3 − zQ1|. [AR:Better
refs?]

The gauging of ﬂavour-universal symmetries leads to
further model building requirements for the quark mass
spectrum, as the Yukawa matrices are now subject to
additional constraints. Additional charged Higgs ﬁelds
are required, which necessarily lie above the EW scale
given the current LHC constraints. Thus, while quark
ﬂavour-violation could be mediated via a light Z(cid:48), the
model would necessarily involve charged states above the
EW scale, and thus UV new physics.

F. Baryon number violation

New non-SM sources of baryon number violation, for
which the primary precision experiments are searches for
proton decay, necessarily require new UV physics. Since
the minimal baryonic vertex is irrelevant, the most fea-
sible way of introducing a low energy mediation mecha-
nism is to gauge B, introducing a U (1)B vector (see e.g.
[91]). Since B is anomalous, this necessarily requires the
introduction of new charged states, which fall into the
category of new UV physics in our classiﬁcation.

4. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have explored the sensitivity of pre-
cision observables to UV-complete models of light NP.
While it is common to automatically interpret preci-
sion measurements in terms of generic scenarios of new
physics at or above the electroweak scale, we have pointed
out that many of these observables are often most sim-
ply considered within models of weakly-coupled hidden
sectors. More precisely, we ﬁnd that the neutrino portal
allows for a description of many observables in the lep-
tonic sector. Only the observables that intrinsically in-
volve quark ﬂavour violation, baryon number violation,
or changes to the charged currents (and thus electroweak
symmetry breaking) seemingly allow an unambiguous in-
teroperation in term of new short-distance physics.

In particle physics, precision tests for rare phenomena (ﬂavor oscillations and decays, electric
dipole moments etc) are often sensitive to the eﬀects of New Physics (NP) encoded in higher-
dimensional operators with Wilson coeﬃcients given by C/(ΛNP)n, where C is dimensionless, n ≥ 1,
and ΛNP is some energy scale. Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM), predict ΛNP to be at
or greater than the electroweak scale, and the search for NP at ultra-short distance scales is often
stated as the primary goal of precision frontier experiments. In rather general terms, we investigate
the alternative possibility: C (cid:28) 1, and ΛNP (cid:28) mW , to identify classes of precision measurements
that can be induced by light NP (hidden sectors) which require no ultraviolet completion with
additional new states at or above the electroweak scale. We ﬁnd that ﬂavour-diagonal CP violation,
EDMs, lepton ﬂavor violation, as well as lepton g − 2 can be induced at interesting levels by hidden
sectors with light degrees of freedom, while many ﬂavor observables from the hadronic sector, and
precision probes of charged currents typically require new physics with Λ >∼ mW .

1.

INTRODUCTION

Accelerator-based particle physics has the goal of prob-
ing the shortest distance scales directly, by colliding par-
ticles and their constituents at high energies. Thus far,
all existing experimental results at high energy are well
described by the Standard Model (SM) of particles and
ﬁelds, with the last missing element, the Higgs boson,
identiﬁed recently [1, 2]. Attention is now focused on the
search for ‘new physics’ (NP) that would complement the
SM, and address some of its shortcomings. However, the
most prominent empirical evidence for new physics, asso-
ciated for example with neutrino mass and dark matter,
does not always point to a high NP mass scale, leaving
the great dilemma of where it may be hidden.

Fortunately, experiments at the energy frontier are not
the only tools available to probe NP: they are supple-
mented by important searches at the precision (and in-
tensity) frontier (see e.g. [3]). Precision observables, par-
ticularly those that probe violations of exact or approx-
imate symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) such as
CP and ﬂavour, play an important role in the search for
new physics [4–7]. The reach in energy scale, through
the loop-induced corrections of new UV physics to preci-
sion observables can often extend well beyond the direct
reach of high energy colliders. However, measurements
at low energies are sensitive not only to NP corrections
coming from the short distances, but also to NP possibly
located at low energy, with extremely weak coupling to
the SM. It is therefore prudent to question which preci-
sion observables with a measured deviation from the SM
prediction could unambiguously be identiﬁed with short-
distance NP at the electroweak (EW) scale and above, or
if such deviations might also admit an interpretation in
terms of new low-scale hidden sector degrees of freedom.
This is the question we will address in this paper.

The sensitivity of any constraint on new physics is de-
termined on one hand by the precision of the measure-
ment in question, and on the other by the accuracy and

FIG. 1. A schematic view of the parameter space of mass
scale vs coupling for physics beyond the SM. The horizontal
axis represents the mass (or energy) scale, whereas the ver-
tical scale shows the visibility of the model, in terms of the
coupling to the SM. The blue visible area is accessible through
direct search experiments. While new high energy physics can
contribute to all precision observables, as discussed in this pa-
per there are interesting classes of observables that are also
sensitive to low mass new physics. These are shown in green,
and include lepton universality (LU), lepton ﬂavour violation
(LFV), lepton g − 2 (MDM), lepton number violation (LNV)
and classes of electric dipole moments (EDMs). However, ob-
servables in the hadronic sector in red, e.g. quark ﬂavour
violation (HFV) and baryon number violation (BNV), gener-
ally require some high scale new physics. The arrows indicate
the pressure imposed on models due to increasing sensitivity

background contributions. If the eﬀective Lagrangian is
schematically written in the form L = LSM + LNP, the
possibility of discovery relies on being able to reliably
bound the NP contribution to the observable away from
zero. The natural tendency to interpret such a result in
terms of LNP induced by ultraviolet NP beyond the SM
energy scales can be problematic, as LNP can in general
also receive contributions from light weakly-coupled NP.
Nothing illustrates this dilemma better than the theo-
retical interpretation of a NP discovery that has already
occurred, namely the observation of neutrino ﬂavor os-
cillations. The experimental results are most straightfor-
wardly interpreted in terms of the masses and mixing of
the light active neutrino species [8, 9]. But, as is well
known, there is a multitude of possible explanations for
their origin. These include a short-distance explanation
in terms of the dimension-ﬁve Weinberg operator [10],
LNP ∝ (HL)(HL)/ΛUV with ΛUV (cid:29) (cid:104)H(cid:105), which gener-
ates neutrino masses scaling as (cid:104)H(cid:105)2/ΛUV. There are also
a variety of diﬀerent UV completions for this operator,
with and without heavy right-handed neutrino states,
that exists throughout the theory literature. While this
interpretation is certainly valid, there is also the possi-
bility of interpreting neutrino mass as a consequence of
very light states mN (cid:28) mW with quantum numbers of
RH neutrinos [11–16]. Such states would typically be
very weakly coupled to SM neutrinos, thus escaping di-
rect detection. The most prominent model in this class
is the simple three-generation extension of the SM by N
states that form Dirac masses for the active neutrinos.
Thus we see that neutrino oscillations can be interpreted
as a result of UV or IR new physics (or both).

In this paper we scrutinize several classes of precision
frontier measurements, and confront them with the possi-
bility of NP conﬁned solely to low energy scales. Our goal
is to ﬁnd speciﬁc examples of light NP that can induce
CP -violation, cause deviations from calculated values of
g − 2, or lead to ﬂavour changing eﬀects. One condition
we set on the classes of such models is the absence of
additional physics at or above the EW scale.
In other
words, we shall focus on UV complete models of light
NP. Given the wealth of particle physics data, only very
speciﬁc classes of light NP models can still be hidden
below the weak scale. In Section 2, we discuss this classi-
ﬁcation of infrared new physics scenarios in more detail.
In section 3, we then discuss a number of diﬀerent lep-
tonic and hadronic observables, and explore simple new
physics scenarios which provide a possible interpretation
of any deviation in precision measurements. We summa-
rize the analysis in Section 4. A schematic overview of
the results is presented in Fig. 1, which illustrates the
classes of (primarily leptonic) observables that can nat-
urally be interpreted in terms of light UV-complete new
physics.

2. UV AND IR NEW PHYSICS

A simple characterization of UV and IR new physics
scenarios follows by making the devision at the elec-
troweak scale, so that the chiral electroweak SU (2)L ×
U (1)Y structure is maintained,

LNP = LUV + LIR.

(1)

New UV physics can then be universally described by a
series of higher dimensional operators constructed from
SM degrees of freedom,

(cid:88)

d≥5

LUV =

Od.

Λd−4

UV

(2)

Maintaining SM gauge invariance explicitly, we demand
that Od can be written in an SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant
form. The lowest dimension d = 5 includes only LHLH-
type operators, which contribute to neutrino mass. The
number of operators grows rapidly at d = 6 and above
[ML:[17]] . We impose no restrictions on these operators,
other than that ΛUV (cid:29) mZ, so that they can consistently
be written in SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant form. Unless
these new operators violate some of the well-tested exact
or approximate discrete symmetries of the SM, ΛUV can
be taken fairly close to the EW scale.
It is important
to notice that the new states appearing at ΛUV could be
charged under any of the SM gauge groups, and some of
the most stringent constraints in cases where no speciﬁc
symmetries are violated now come from the LHC.

In comparison, new IR physics is more constrained. A
convenient categorization of light scenarios can be con-
structed as follows:

A. Portals: Neutral hidden sectors, with operators of
dimension d ≤ 4, can couple through a restricted
set of renormalizable interaction channels, the vec-
tor, Higgs and neutrino portals (see e.g. [18]). Such
models of light new physics are fully UV complete
without any charged states.

B. Anomaly free (neutral): Light hidden sectors can
also be charged under anomaly free combinations of
SM symmetries. For anomaly free symmetries, such
as B − L or Lµ − Lτ that do not involve individual
quark ﬂavours, while additional Higgs ﬁelds may be
necessary to retain a viable mass spectrum. These
additional states can be SM-neutral and so these
scenarios also fall into the category of UV-complete
and gauge-neutral hidden sectors.

C. Anomaly free (charged): Light hidden sectors
charged under anomaly-free, but quark ﬂavour non-
universal, symmetries such Qf1 − Qf2 require new
charged Higgs states to restore the mass spectrum.
Thus, these new physics scenarios generally require
charged states at or above the EW scale.

D. Anomalous: Light hidden sectors charged under
anomalous SM symmetries, such as B or L, nec-
essarily require additional (heavy) charged states
at or above the EW scale, and so again do not fall
into the category of IR new physics scenarios con-
sidered here.
Indeed, as emphasized for example
by Preskill [19], from the low energy perspective,
anomalous theories are phenomenologically analo-
gous to UV new physics scenarios with a speciﬁc
UV cutoﬀ.

Based on this categorization, we will limit our atten-
tion to cases A and B, namely those which do not require
new charged states at or above the EW scale for consis-
tency. Thus we construct our model examples according
to the following rules:

• The dimensionality of operators in the IR sector is
restricted to d ≤ 4, as a necessary condition for UV
completeness.

• The IR sector cannot contain new SM-charged
states. (Otherwise, such states will have to be close
to or above the EW scale modulo some exceptional
cases where masses as low as ∼ 60 GeV may still
be viable [20]). New charged states fall into the
category of NP at the EW scale, and form part of
LUV.
• The gauge extensions of the SM are restricted to
anomaly-free combinations, which is also a generic
requirement of UV completeness [19].

• We shall not question naturalness of possible mass
hierarchies, mIR (cid:28) mW , and will take them as
given.

The simplest type of neutral hidden sector (case A)
requires new scalars Si, neutral fermions Ni and/or new
U (1) gauge boson(s) Aµ [21]. The most economical renor-
malizable portal interactions for these states can be writ-
ten as
LIR = κBµνVµν−H

H(AS+λS2)+YN LHN +Lhid, (3)

†

and can be trivially generalized for multiple new ﬁelds.
Once coupled to the SM, the IR sector can be almost arbi-
trarily complicated. S and N can couple to a more com-
plex hidden sector involving dark abelian or non-abelian
gauge groups, possibly with additional scalar or fermion
states charged under those hidden gauge groups. The full
hidden sector Lagrangian simply needs to comply with
the conditions above. The interactions in (3) assume that
the SM is strictly neutral under the extra U (1), but this
is unnecessarily restrictive. Light NP models (in case B)
may also include non-anomalous global symmetries such
as B− L and Li− Lj etc, where SM ﬁelds receive charges
under the new U (1).

It is also important to discuss some examples of theo-
ries that do not satisfy the above criteria. For example,
a light pseudoscalar a coupled via the axion portal to

TABLE I. Observables sensitive to the distinct classes of light
new physics models discussed in Section 2.

a SM fermion ψ, ∂µa/fa × ¯ψγµγ5ψ, clearly requires UV
completion at some high energy scale ∼ fa.
Interest-
ingly, a light scalar directly coupled to the scalar fermion
density, S ¯ψψ, is allowed, provided that this coupling de-
scends from the Higgs portal ASH†H, once the heavy SM
Higgs particle is integrated out. This means, of course,
that the ratio of the eﬀective Yukawa couplings of S to
ψ will obey the same relations as in the SM, and any de-
viations from this pattern would imply the existence of
new Higgs doublets charged under SM, hence some new
physics at or above the EW scale.

We turn in the next section to discuss a range of preci-
sion observables, and seek to classify them into categories
which can receive signiﬁcant contributions from IR new
physics. Table 1 summarizes the results from the next
section, and reﬁnes the schematic classiﬁcation of Fig. 1
according to the categorization of new physics models
A–B introduced above.

3. PRECISION OBSERVABLES

A. Lepton anomalous magnetic moments

The anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and
the muon represent observables where the SM contribu-
tion can be evaluated to high accuracy [ML:[22, 23]] .
For electrons, the sensitivity of NP tests also depends
on an independent determination of the electromagnetic
ﬁne structure constant. Currently, g − 2 of the electron
(and related measurements) probe NP contributions at
the level ∆ae(NP) < 1.64× 10−12 (see e.g. [24]), whereas
g−2 of the muon famously exhibits a ∼ 3.5σ discrepancy
[23] between the measurement and the SM prediction,
with the central value giving ∆aµ (cid:39) +3 × 10−9.

It is tempting to interpret this discrepancy as a con-
sequence of NP that adds a positive contribution to the
predicted SM value. While many UV interpretations ex-
ist (see e.g. [25] ), ∆aµ(NP) can just as easily result from
one-loop contributions of light particles. At the eﬀective
Lagrangian level, both g(cid:48)Vν ¯µγνµ and λ(cid:48)S ¯µµ can supply
the requisite correction if

−9.

(4)

This fact is well-appreciated in the literature [26–28].

The vector model can be UV completed via the in-
troduction of a kinetically mixed vector, or alternatively
a symmetry based on gauged muon number, such as
Lµ − Lτ . Dedicated searches for ‘dark photons’ [18] have
now placed signiﬁcant restrictions on the parameter space
of this model. At this point, the kinetically mixed option
for the explanation of ∆aµ (cid:39) 3 × 10−9 is almost entirely
ruled out through direct production experiments assum-
ing that V decays back primarily to SM states [29, 30].
Moreover, the alternative option of vectors decaying to
light dark matter is also signiﬁcantly constrained [31–33].
On the other hand, a model with mutliple (cascading) de-
cays of V into the hidden sector can be ruled out only
via missing energy signatures, and up to now, signiﬁcant
parameter space is still open for ∆aµ ∼ O(10−9). The
Lµ − Lτ explanation is even less constrained, with only
trident neutrino production providing an adequate level
of sensitivity [34, 35]. We conclude that there are mul-
tiple IR models of NP that can lead to the observable
shifts in g − 2, while at the same time escaping direct
detection constraints.

In contrast, models based on scalar particles do not
provide large shifts to ∆aµ. For example, UV completion
via Higgs mixing would imply

as other constraints on the model force A to be much
small, A (cid:28) mh. Thus, larger λ(cid:48) would force additional
NP to appear at the weak scale.

B. Lepton ﬂavour violation and universality

We now turn to leptonic ﬂavour-violating observables.
In analyzing IR new physics scenarios, it will be conve-
nient to have in mind a speciﬁc hidden sector coupled
through the neutrino portal. In particular, to the three
left-handed active neutrinos νl, l = e, µ, τ , we add corre-
sponding right-handed neutrinos NR, plus a number of
extra singlet fermion states NS. Since we are focussing
on light NP, it will prove advantageous to use an inverse
seesaw scheme for neutrino masses [36, 37] rather than
type-I see-saw model,

characterized by one scale also denoted MD,  respec-
tively (this involves ﬁne tuning, since in general it is
not possible to simultaneously diagonalize both matri-
ces). The visible Dirac masses mD are nearly diagonal,
but not universal, so that mD can be characterized by
three parameters mDe,µ,τ , thus mνl ≈ m2

a. Lepton ﬂavor violation One characteristic lepton
ﬂavour violating (LFV) observable is the µ → eγ de-
cay, whose branching ratio is experimentally constrained
to Br(µ− → e−γ) < 5.7 · 10−13 [38, 39]. The MEG-II
upgrade is expected to have suﬃcient sensitivity to re-
duce this upper bound by about one order of magnitude
[40]. Within the context of the SM, this process proceeds
through a W − ν loop, an example of which is shown in
Fig. 2. Including corrections from the massive neutrinos,
the result is Br(µ → eγ) = (3α/32π)δ2

which ends up being a much tighter constraint on the
mass parameters than the µ → eγ branching ratio. Var-
ious experiments, either running or in planning, project
to reduce the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude
[51, 52].

b. Lepton Universality

It is possible to reﬁne the
mass constraint on the new degrees of freedom, by uti-
lizing tests of lepton universality tests. There exist var-
ious standard decay channels to test lepton universality,
[45, 53, 54].
In particular, we will focus on τ decays,
through the Rτ observable deﬁned as
Γ(τ− → e−νν)
Γ(τ− → µ−νν)

Rτ =

eigenstates and Γ(τ− → e−νν) =(cid:80)

In the SM, because the neutrinos are massless, the ﬂavor
eigenstates νl and mass eigenstates νi coincide so that
Γ(τ− → e−νν) = Γ(τ− → l−ντ νl).
In a general set-
ting though, the masses are linear combinations of ﬂavor
i,j Γ(τ− → l−νiνj).
The Rτ ratio has recently been measured by the BaBar
collaboration, Rτ = 0.9796 ± 0.0016 ± 0.0036 [55], which
we will simply approximate as Rτ ≈ 1 ± ∆Rτ , with
∆Rτ = 0.0052. In general, decay rates have a somewhat
complex dependence on the various lepton and neutrino
masses [56],

In this expression, we have ignored small radiative cor-

simplify the analysis, we split the mN mass range into
5 regions, and take the function f to be equal to 0 or
1 depending on whether the decay channel is allowed.
Using unitarity, it will always be possible to express the
visible-visible mixing in terms of the visible-hidden mix-
l , since we
assumed Uli = Θl, with Nh the number of hidden ﬂavors.

press Θµ,τ as functions of , Θe, we can present the LFV

For this particular light NP model, stronger sensitivity
actually comes from µ − e conversion in nuclei [47–49].
There are two transition channels for this process. First,
the photonic transition, through the same diagram as
the µ → eγ on-shell transition, except the photon is now
connected to the nucleus. The second, through the non-
photonic transition, which occurs either through Z-boson
exchange or a box diagram mediated by W -bosons. It
turns out the non-photonic transition is dominated by
the box diagram. Since we focus on the light neutrino
regime here, we utilize the result that the box diagram
receives a large enhancement in this regime compared to
the photonic transition, i.e. r = Γγ/Γγ ∼ 103 [47], and
the box diagram dominates the µ − e conversion rate.
The conversion rate compared to muon capture in the
nucleus, Rµ−e = Γ(µ − e)/Γcapture, is given by

normally interpreted directly in terms of the light neu-
trino mass spectrum [62, 63]. Given the existing mass
limits on the light eigenstates, the decay rate depends
on meﬀ
eimi. However, an experimental detec-
tion could instead be due to heavier singlets unrelated to
neutrino oscillations, such as those considered above in
the context of lepton ﬂavor violation.

Utilizing the same neutrino model as in the previous
section, we recall that the heavy mass eigenstates Ni mix
with νe, and we can write the mass eigenstates as Ni =
Ueiνe+··· . It will be suﬃcient to work with the following

The nuclear form factor w(p0,|(cid:126)p|) has been approximated
by a step function w ∼ w0Θ(p0 − EF )Θ(|(cid:126)p| − pF ), with
w0 ∼ 4 MeV−1 [64] in terms of the nucleon Fermi mo-
mentum pF ∼ 100 MeV. (A more precise interpolating
formula is given in [65].)

When the dominant contribution is from the light
active neutrinos, the experimental bounds translate to
(cid:46) 2eV. Note that when the singlet mass mN (cid:29)

The above bound is displayed in Fig. 3 for comparison
with the sensitivity from LFV observables. LNV provides
a subleading constraint within this particular inverse see-
saw model, since the lepton number violating parameter
is  which is taken negligible compared to the other mass
parameters. However, more signiﬁcant sensitivity to the
mixing angle arises in the standard seesaw model, where
we enlarge the Majorana terms in the mass matrix. For
example, a recent analysis [65] of the current limits on
the half-lives of 76Ge and 136Xe obtained the constraints
|U 2
eN| < 10−8 − 10−6 as mN varies from 1 − 100 GeV.
These limits are more stringent than those from direct
searches (e.g. from Z decays) for mN > few GeV. That
analysis considers sterile neutrinos whose masses come
predominantly from the Majorana mass term.

FIG. 3. Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) show the allowed region in the

[ML:The range of MD is bounded above by the requirement
to keep MD < mW , and from below to satisfy the 0νββ con-
straint MD (cid:29) 0.1 GeV. In particular, we note that at large ,
the µ− e conversion constraint is by far the strongest, though
the τ → lνν becomes stronger at low .] [ML:Removed text]

plots are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that this simple light
NP model can provide a natural interpretation for devia-
tions observed in µ → e conversion or lepton universality.

C. Lepton number violation

servable for L-violation, and the current limits [57–61] are

ited from the size of the Majorana mass term , which is
set by the constraint on the active neutrino mass squared
diﬀerences. Therefore, within this model it is not possible
to generate a sizeable EDM. However, a far larger EDM
is possible in a variant of this model with an extra visible-
hidden Dirac mass coupling m2. Namely, we switch gear

D. Electric dipole moments

Electric dipole moments (EDMs) provide an important
class of precision CP -odd observables. The only UV-
complete CP -odd mediation channel is via the neutrino
portal, and the phases in the Yukawa matrix YN , pro-
vided there are at least two singlet neutrinos Ni. These
phases can contribute to leptogenesis at high scales and
induce various CP -violating observables, but at a level
that is characteristically suppressed at low energy by the
neutrino masses. We will ﬁrst consider lepton EDMs
induced through this channel before turning to more
generic light NP mechanisms, and then turn to hadronic
EDMs which are distinct as they can be generated at or
close to the current level of sensitivity through the QCD
θ-term.

c. Paramagnetic (and leptonic) EDMs

In the SM
extended with massive neutrinos, it is possible to gener-
ate an EDM at the two-loop level [66–68], an example of
which is shown in Fig. 4. These diagrams can be shown
to scale as

trino mass eigenstates. Up to now, we have ignored the
possible CP -odd phases in this model. However, in gen-
eral not all the mass parameters are real. We choose
to leave the physical CP -odd phase in mD = |mD|eiη,
and for ease of writing, replace |mD| simply with mD.
Given that the mixing angles are mD/MD (cid:46) 0.1, we
see that the contribution from the diagram with two in-
ternal light neutrinos will be tiny, O(mν1mν2∆m2
21).
Thus, we need only look at the cases where either one
or two internal neutrinos are heavy, respectively called
the h − l or h − h contributions. Looking at the h − h
contribution, the mixing that enters is Γ+−, but both
U 2
e+ and U 2
e− have the same phase since they are con-
trolled by mD/MD. The CP -odd phase thus cancels
from the h− h contribution. Next, the h− l contribution

bound to ∼ 10−33e·cm, which is still much lower than the
current experimental upper limit de < 8.7 × 10−29e · cm
[69].

Taking a more general approach, we consider a more
complex light hidden sector. We introduce a Dirac
fermion ψ charged under U (1)V with CP -violating cou-
plings to the scalar singlet S [70–75],

LCP
hid = ¯ψiγµDV

µ ψ + ¯ψ(mψ + S(YS + i ˜YSγ5))ψ.

(27)
µ = ∂µ − e(cid:48)qψVµ. This hidden sector CP -
where DV
violation can then be mediated to the SM via the CP -
even vector and Higgs portals.

Loops of ψ can induce the CP -odd hF ˜F vertex shown
in Fig. 5, which contributes to EDMs via Barr-Zee-type
diagrams for example. For simplicity, we assume that V
is parametrically lighter than S and ψ, so the EDM takes
the form (see e.g. [76])

which is still well below the current sensitivity to the
electron EDM [69]. The main constraint, as alluded to
above, is the need to ensure that mV is suﬃciently small
which limits the size of κ < 10−4.

Another contribution to the experimentally accessible
paramagnetic EDMs of atoms and molecules is the semi-
leptonic interaction CS ¯N N eiγ5e. This operator can also
be generated by through the hV ˜V vertex, and allows ac-
cess to a regime with larger mV for which the constraints
on κ are somewhat weaker. However, this contribution is
still not at a level that can approach the current exper-
imental sensitivity. Thus, at least within this restricted
class of hidden sectors, we conclude that paramagnetic
EDMs (and lepton EDMs) are in practice a probe of UV
new physics.

d. Diamagnetic (and hadronic) EDMs Hadronic
EDMs can also be induced using the same mechanism
as outlined above, using the hidden sector Bazz-Zee di-
agram, but as above this will necessarily be below the
current level of sensitivity. However, hadronic EDMs
can also be generated by the QCD θ-term, which is a
marginal operator [77–80]. The strongest current limits
in this sector are from the EDMs of the neutron and from
the Hg atom,

where the apparent strength of the Hg EDM bound is
tempered by Schiﬀ screening of the nuclear EDM. The

[AR:Numerically, the ﬁnal kinetic mixing required to con-
vert the operator from a V -electric dipole moment to an
EDM is problematic, as it introduces signiﬁcant momen-
tum suppression unless 1/mV is smaller than the char-
acteristic atomic or molecular scale.
In particular, we
require mV < 1/(meαZ), and in this regime there are
strong constraints on κ through the impact of V -loops
on g− 2 of the electron. Inserting qψ = 1, α(cid:48) = α, ˜YS = 1

This leads to the current constraint on ¯θ < 10−10.
The contribution of ¯θ to dHg is more complex, and for
some time it appeared that it would be isospin sup-
pressed as the Schiﬀ moment was primarily sensitive to
¯g1(¯θ) ∼ 0.001¯θ rather than ¯g0(¯θ). However, more recent
analyses of the Hg Schiﬀ moment have indicated that ¯g0
may provide a comparable contribution to ¯g1. Taking the
current ‘best values’ indeed indicates that the dominant
contribution from ¯θ would be through ¯g0, and we have
dHg(¯θ) ∼ 5 × 10

0.05 × 10−10 + O(¯g1(¯θ))

This is a factor of 6 below the current bound, but given
that the precision of the calculation is generally under-
stood to be at the order of magnitude level, it is clear that
a nonzero detection of dHg could not unambiguously be
interpreted as a contribution of a source other than ¯θ.

γVVψγShγ5We conclude that at the current stage, nonzero detec-
tions for the dominant hadronic EDMs observables could
be explained without additional UV new physics, but
simply through new QCD physics in the form of ¯θ. Fur-
ther improvements in the sensitivity to dn could of course
change this picture.

E. Quark ﬂavour violation

We now turn to precision quark ﬂavour-violating ob-
servables, with the b → sγ transition as a benchmark.
There are a couple of features which clearly distinguish
these observables, with regard to the role of light new
physics. Firstly, since the RH states are charged, there is
no analogue of the neutrino portal, and thus no renormal-
izable ﬂavour violating interactions that do not involve
new charged states. Given the existing limits on new light
degrees of freedom which are charged, this almost auto-
matically puts quark ﬂavour violating observables into a
category that is sensitive to UV new physics only. The
second distinguishing feature is that the SM generally
provides non-negligible contributions to quark ﬂavour vi-
olation through the CKM matrix. Utilizing a W -boson
loop at leading order for example, the SM contributes to
Br( ¯B → Xsγ) = (3.60±0.30)·10−4 [83], while the BaBar
sensitivity is Br( ¯B → Xsγ) (cid:39) (3.15 ± 0.23) · 10−4 [84].
Thus, the sensitivity to new physics is also determined
by the precision of SM calculations.

Since these observables are not primarily sensitive to
light new physics in the categories that we have delin-
eated, we will not consider them in detail. However, it
is worth outlining how a model with low energy ﬂavour
violation can be realized, albeit one that still relies on ad-
ditional heavy charged states. We will consider a model
in which we gauge an anomaly-free U (1)(cid:48) combination of
quark ﬂavours, Qf 1 − Qf 2 [85, 86], with a diagonal (and
vectorial) gauge coupling of the form [87–90],

(cid:88)

LZ(cid:48) = gzZ

(cid:48)
µ

zf ¯qγµq,

(37)

q=Qf ,uf ,df

with e.g. zQ3 = zb = −zQ2 = −zs = 1. On transforming
to the mass eigenstate basis, this non-universal coupling
will generate a ﬂavour-violating b − s − Z(cid:48) vertex, and
mediate ﬂavour violating transitions.
In practice, this
imposes signiﬁcant constraints on the combinations of
gzzQ,b,s, and is usually used to motivate ﬂavour-universal
U (1)(cid:48) charge assignments. Here, we are interested in hav-
ing a light Z(cid:48) that can indeed mediate these transitions
at the level to which current experiments are sensitive.
If we assign integer charges, then a small gauge coupling
gz ∼ 10−5 will be suﬃcient for this purpose. As has

9
recently been emphasized [86], K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing requires
gz|zQ2 −zQ1| < 10−5MZ(cid:48)/(1 GeV), while B0− ¯B0 mixing
imposes similar constraints on gz|zQ3 − zQ1|. [AR:Better
refs?]

The gauging of ﬂavour-universal symmetries leads to
further model building requirements for the quark mass
spectrum, as the Yukawa matrices are now subject to
additional constraints. Additional charged Higgs ﬁelds
are required, which necessarily lie above the EW scale
given the current LHC constraints. Thus, while quark
ﬂavour-violation could be mediated via a light Z(cid:48), the
model would necessarily involve charged states above the
EW scale, and thus UV new physics.

F. Baryon number violation

New non-SM sources of baryon number violation, for
which the primary precision experiments are searches for
proton decay, necessarily require new UV physics. Since
the minimal baryonic vertex is irrelevant, the most fea-
sible way of introducing a low energy mediation mecha-
nism is to gauge B, introducing a U (1)B vector (see e.g.
[91]). Since B is anomalous, this necessarily requires the
introduction of new charged states, which fall into the
category of new UV physics in our classiﬁcation.

4. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have explored the sensitivity of pre-
cision observables to UV-complete models of light NP.
While it is common to automatically interpret preci-
sion measurements in terms of generic scenarios of new
physics at or above the electroweak scale, we have pointed
out that many of these observables are often most sim-
ply considered within models of weakly-coupled hidden
sectors. More precisely, we ﬁnd that the neutrino portal
allows for a description of many observables in the lep-
tonic sector. Only the observables that intrinsically in-
volve quark ﬂavour violation, baryon number violation,
or changes to the charged currents (and thus electroweak
symmetry breaking) seemingly allow an unambiguous in-
teroperation in term of new short-distance physics.

Sensitivity to light weakly-coupled new physics at the precision frontier

In particle physics, precision tests for rare phenomena (ﬂavor oscillations and decays, electric
dipole moments etc) are often sensitive to the eﬀects of New Physics (NP) encoded in higher-
dimensional operators with Wilson coeﬃcients given by C/(ΛNP)n, where C is dimensionless, n ≥ 1,
and ΛNP is some energy scale. Many extensions of the Standard Model (SM), predict ΛNP to be at
or greater than the electroweak scale, and the search for NP at ultra-short distance scales is often
stated as the primary goal of precision frontier experiments. In rather general terms, we investigate
the alternative possibility: C (cid:28) 1, and ΛNP (cid:28) mW , to identify classes of precision measurements
that can be induced by light NP (hidden sectors) which require no ultraviolet completion with
additional new states at or above the electroweak scale. We ﬁnd that ﬂavour-diagonal CP violation,
EDMs, lepton ﬂavor violation, as well as lepton g − 2 can be induced at interesting levels by hidden
sectors with light degrees of freedom, while many ﬂavor observables from the hadronic sector, and
precision probes of charged currents typically require new physics with Λ >∼ mW .

INTRODUCTION

Accelerator-based particle physics has the goal of prob-
ing the shortest distance scales directly, by colliding par-
ticles and their constituents at high energies. Thus far,
all existing experimental results at high energy are well
described by the Standard Model (SM) of particles and
ﬁelds, with the last missing element, the Higgs boson,
identiﬁed recently [1, 2]. Attention is now focused on the
search for ‘new physics’ (NP) that would complement the
SM, and address some of its shortcomings. However, the
most prominent empirical evidence for new physics, asso-
ciated for example with neutrino mass and dark matter,
does not always point to a high NP mass scale, leaving
the great dilemma of where it may be hidden.

Fortunately, experiments at the energy frontier are not
the only tools available to probe NP: they are supple-
mented by important searches at the precision (and in-
tensity) frontier (see e.g. [3]). Precision observables, par-
ticularly those that probe violations of exact or approx-
imate symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) such as
CP and ﬂavour, play an important role in the search for
new physics [4–7]. The reach in energy scale, through
the loop-induced corrections of new UV physics to preci-
sion observables can often extend well beyond the direct
reach of high energy colliders. However, measurements
at low energies are sensitive not only to NP corrections
coming from the short distances, but also to NP possibly
located at low energy, with extremely weak coupling to
the SM. It is therefore prudent to question which preci-
sion observables with a measured deviation from the SM
prediction could unambiguously be identiﬁed with short-
distance NP at the electroweak (EW) scale and above, or
if such deviations might also admit an interpretation in
terms of new low-scale hidden sector degrees of freedom.
This is the question we will address in this paper.

The sensitivity of any constraint on new physics is de-
termined on one hand by the precision of the measure-
ment in question, and on the other by the accuracy and

FIG. 1. A schematic view of the parameter space of mass
scale vs coupling for physics beyond the SM. The horizontal
axis represents the mass (or energy) scale, whereas the ver-
tical scale shows the visibility of the model, in terms of the
coupling to the SM. The blue visible area is accessible through
direct search experiments. While new high energy physics can
contribute to all precision observables, as discussed in this pa-
per there are interesting classes of observables that are also
sensitive to low mass new physics. These are shown in green,
and include lepton universality (LU), lepton ﬂavour violation
(LFV), lepton g − 2 (MDM), lepton number violation (LNV)
and classes of electric dipole moments (EDMs). However, ob-
servables in the hadronic sector in red, e.g. quark ﬂavour
violation (HFV) and baryon number violation (BNV), gener-
ally require some high scale new physics. The arrows indicate
the pressure imposed on models due to increasing sensitivity

background contributions. If the eﬀective Lagrangian is
schematically written in the form L = LSM + LNP, the
possibility of discovery relies on being able to reliably
bound the NP contribution to the observable away from
zero. The natural tendency to interpret such a result in
terms of LNP induced by ultraviolet NP beyond the SM
energy scales can be problematic, as LNP can in general
also receive contributions from light weakly-coupled NP.
Nothing illustrates this dilemma better than the theo-
retical interpretation of a NP discovery that has already
occurred, namely the observation of neutrino ﬂavor os-
cillations. The experimental results are most straightfor-
wardly interpreted in terms of the masses and mixing of
the light active neutrino species [8, 9]. But, as is well
known, there is a multitude of possible explanations for
their origin. These include a short-distance explanation
in terms of the dimension-ﬁve Weinberg operator [10],
LNP ∝ (HL)(HL)/ΛUV with ΛUV (cid:29) (cid:104)H(cid:105), which gener-
ates neutrino masses scaling as (cid:104)H(cid:105)2/ΛUV. There are also
a variety of diﬀerent UV completions for this operator,
with and without heavy right-handed neutrino states,
that exists throughout the theory literature. While this
interpretation is certainly valid, there is also the possi-
bility of interpreting neutrino mass as a consequence of
very light states mN (cid:28) mW with quantum numbers of
RH neutrinos [11–16]. Such states would typically be
very weakly coupled to SM neutrinos, thus escaping di-
rect detection. The most prominent model in this class
is the simple three-generation extension of the SM by N
states that form Dirac masses for the active neutrinos.
Thus we see that neutrino oscillations can be interpreted
as a result of UV or IR new physics (or both).

In this paper we scrutinize several classes of precision
frontier measurements, and confront them with the possi-
bility of NP conﬁned solely to low energy scales. Our goal
is to ﬁnd speciﬁc examples of light NP that can induce
CP -violation, cause deviations from calculated values of
g − 2, or lead to ﬂavour changing eﬀects. One condition
we set on the classes of such models is the absence of
additional physics at or above the EW scale.
In other
words, we shall focus on UV complete models of light
NP. Given the wealth of particle physics data, only very
speciﬁc classes of light NP models can still be hidden
below the weak scale. In Section 2, we discuss this classi-
ﬁcation of infrared new physics scenarios in more detail.
In section 3, we then discuss a number of diﬀerent lep-
tonic and hadronic observables, and explore simple new
physics scenarios which provide a possible interpretation
of any deviation in precision measurements. We summa-
rize the analysis in Section 4. A schematic overview of
the results is presented in Fig. 1, which illustrates the
classes of (primarily leptonic) observables that can nat-
urally be interpreted in terms of light UV-complete new
physics.

2. UV AND IR NEW PHYSICS

A simple characterization of UV and IR new physics
scenarios follows by making the devision at the elec-
troweak scale, so that the chiral electroweak SU (2)L ×
U (1)Y structure is maintained,

LNP = LUV + LIR.

(1)

New UV physics can then be universally described by a
series of higher dimensional operators constructed from
SM degrees of freedom,

(cid:88)

d≥5

LUV =

Od.

Λd−4

UV

(2)

Maintaining SM gauge invariance explicitly, we demand
that Od can be written in an SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant
form. The lowest dimension d = 5 includes only LHLH-
type operators, which contribute to neutrino mass. The
number of operators grows rapidly at d = 6 and above
[ML:[17]] . We impose no restrictions on these operators,
other than that ΛUV (cid:29) mZ, so that they can consistently
be written in SU (2)L × U (1)Y covariant form. Unless
these new operators violate some of the well-tested exact
or approximate discrete symmetries of the SM, ΛUV can
be taken fairly close to the EW scale.
It is important
to notice that the new states appearing at ΛUV could be
charged under any of the SM gauge groups, and some of
the most stringent constraints in cases where no speciﬁc
symmetries are violated now come from the LHC.

In comparison, new IR physics is more constrained. A
convenient categorization of light scenarios can be con-
structed as follows:

A. Portals: Neutral hidden sectors, with operators of
dimension d ≤ 4, can couple through a restricted
set of renormalizable interaction channels, the vec-
tor, Higgs and neutrino portals (see e.g. [18]). Such
models of light new physics are fully UV complete
without any charged states.

B. Anomaly free (neutral): Light hidden sectors can
also be charged under anomaly free combinations of
SM symmetries. For anomaly free symmetries, such
as B − L or Lµ − Lτ that do not involve individual
quark ﬂavours, while additional Higgs ﬁelds may be
necessary to retain a viable mass spectrum. These
additional states can be SM-neutral and so these
scenarios also fall into the category of UV-complete
and gauge-neutral hidden sectors.

C. Anomaly free (charged): Light hidden sectors
charged under anomaly-free, but quark ﬂavour non-
universal, symmetries such Qf1 − Qf2 require new
charged Higgs states to restore the mass spectrum.
Thus, these new physics scenarios generally require
charged states at or above the EW scale.

D. Anomalous: Light hidden sectors charged under
anomalous SM symmetries, such as B or L, nec-
essarily require additional (heavy) charged states
at or above the EW scale, and so again do not fall
into the category of IR new physics scenarios con-
sidered here.
Indeed, as emphasized for example
by Preskill [19], from the low energy perspective,
anomalous theories are phenomenologically analo-
gous to UV new physics scenarios with a speciﬁc
UV cutoﬀ.

Based on this categorization, we will limit our atten-
tion to cases A and B, namely those which do not require
new charged states at or above the EW scale for consis-
tency. Thus we construct our model examples according
to the following rules:

• The dimensionality of operators in the IR sector is
restricted to d ≤ 4, as a necessary condition for UV
completeness.

• The IR sector cannot contain new SM-charged
states. (Otherwise, such states will have to be close
to or above the EW scale modulo some exceptional
cases where masses as low as ∼ 60 GeV may still
be viable [20]). New charged states fall into the
category of NP at the EW scale, and form part of
LUV.
• The gauge extensions of the SM are restricted to
anomaly-free combinations, which is also a generic
requirement of UV completeness [19].

• We shall not question naturalness of possible mass
hierarchies, mIR (cid:28) mW , and will take them as
given.

The simplest type of neutral hidden sector (case A)
requires new scalars Si, neutral fermions Ni and/or new
U (1) gauge boson(s) Aµ [21]. The most economical renor-
malizable portal interactions for these states can be writ-
ten as
LIR = κBµνVµν−H

H(AS+λS2)+YN LHN +Lhid, (3)

†

and can be trivially generalized for multiple new ﬁelds.
Once coupled to the SM, the IR sector can be almost arbi-
trarily complicated. S and N can couple to a more com-
plex hidden sector involving dark abelian or non-abelian
gauge groups, possibly with additional scalar or fermion
states charged under those hidden gauge groups. The full
hidden sector Lagrangian simply needs to comply with
the conditions above. The interactions in (3) assume that
the SM is strictly neutral under the extra U (1), but this
is unnecessarily restrictive. Light NP models (in case B)
may also include non-anomalous global symmetries such
as B− L and Li− Lj etc, where SM ﬁelds receive charges
under the new U (1).

It is also important to discuss some examples of theo-
ries that do not satisfy the above criteria. For example,
a light pseudoscalar a coupled via the axion portal to

a SM fermion ψ, ∂µa/fa × ¯ψγµγ5ψ, clearly requires UV
completion at some high energy scale ∼ fa.
Interest-
ingly, a light scalar directly coupled to the scalar fermion
density, S ¯ψψ, is allowed, provided that this coupling de-
scends from the Higgs portal ASH†H, once the heavy SM
Higgs particle is integrated out. This means, of course,
that the ratio of the eﬀective Yukawa couplings of S to
ψ will obey the same relations as in the SM, and any de-
viations from this pattern would imply the existence of
new Higgs doublets charged under SM, hence some new
physics at or above the EW scale.

We turn in the next section to discuss a range of preci-
sion observables, and seek to classify them into categories
which can receive signiﬁcant contributions from IR new
physics. Table 1 summarizes the results from the next
section, and reﬁnes the schematic classiﬁcation of Fig. 1
according to the categorization of new physics models
A–B introduced above.

3. PRECISION OBSERVABLES

A. Lepton anomalous magnetic moments

The anomalous magnetic moments of the electron and
the muon represent observables where the SM contribu-
tion can be evaluated to high accuracy [ML:[22, 23]] .
For electrons, the sensitivity of NP tests also depends
on an independent determination of the electromagnetic
ﬁne structure constant. Currently, g − 2 of the electron
(and related measurements) probe NP contributions at
the level ∆ae(NP) < 1.64× 10−12 (see e.g. [24]), whereas
g−2 of the muon famously exhibits a ∼ 3.5σ discrepancy
[23] between the measurement and the SM prediction,
with the central value giving ∆aµ (cid:39) +3 × 10−9.

It is tempting to interpret this discrepancy as a con-
sequence of NP that adds a positive contribution to the
predicted SM value. While many UV interpretations ex-
ist (see e.g. [25] ), ∆aµ(NP) can just as easily result from
one-loop contributions of light particles. At the eﬀective
Lagrangian level, both g(cid:48)Vν ¯µγνµ and λ(cid:48)S ¯µµ can supply
the requisite correction if

(4)

This fact is well-appreciated in the literature [26–28].

The vector model can be UV completed via the in-
troduction of a kinetically mixed vector, or alternatively
a symmetry based on gauged muon number, such as
Lµ − Lτ . Dedicated searches for ‘dark photons’ [18] have
now placed signiﬁcant restrictions on the parameter space
of this model. At this point, the kinetically mixed option
for the explanation of ∆aµ (cid:39) 3 × 10−9 is almost entirely
ruled out through direct production experiments assum-
ing that V decays back primarily to SM states [29, 30].
Moreover, the alternative option of vectors decaying to
light dark matter is also signiﬁcantly constrained [31–33].
On the other hand, a model with mutliple (cascading) de-
cays of V into the hidden sector can be ruled out only
via missing energy signatures, and up to now, signiﬁcant
parameter space is still open for ∆aµ ∼ O(10−9). The
Lµ − Lτ explanation is even less constrained, with only
trident neutrino production providing an adequate level
of sensitivity [34, 35]. We conclude that there are mul-
tiple IR models of NP that can lead to the observable
shifts in g − 2, while at the same time escaping direct
detection constraints.

In contrast, models based on scalar particles do not
provide large shifts to ∆aµ. For example, UV completion
via Higgs mixing would imply

as other constraints on the model force A to be much
small, A (cid:28) mh. Thus, larger λ(cid:48) would force additional
NP to appear at the weak scale.

B. Lepton ﬂavour violation and universality

We now turn to leptonic ﬂavour-violating observables.
In analyzing IR new physics scenarios, it will be conve-
nient to have in mind a speciﬁc hidden sector coupled
through the neutrino portal. In particular, to the three
left-handed active neutrinos νl, l = e, µ, τ , we add corre-
sponding right-handed neutrinos NR, plus a number of
extra singlet fermion states NS. Since we are focussing
on light NP, it will prove advantageous to use an inverse
seesaw scheme for neutrino masses [36, 37] rather than
type-I see-saw model,

in the regime  (cid:28) mD, MD. The Dirac mass terms
mD, MD are matrices, but in the simplest example of
only one active ﬂavor, one right-handed neutrino and one
additional singlet, this model predicts one light and two
heavy mass eigenstates, mν, M± respectively given by,

In order to accommodate the
light neutrino mass spectrum, we choose mD (cid:46) MD, and
 (cid:38) mν. To lowest order, the unitary matrix U that
transforms the mass eigenstates into the ﬂavor eigen-
states takes the form,

Because the ν − S and ν − N mixing is so similar, we

We will generally make the assumptions that the ma-
trices MD,  are diagonal and universal, so that they are
characterized by one scale also denoted MD,  respec-
tively (this involves ﬁne tuning, since in general it is
not possible to simultaneously diagonalize both matri-
ces). The visible Dirac masses mD are nearly diagonal,
but not universal, so that mD can be characterized by
three parameters mDe,µ,τ , thus mνl ≈ m2

a. Lepton ﬂavor violation One characteristic lepton
ﬂavour violating (LFV) observable is the µ → eγ de-
cay, whose branching ratio is experimentally constrained
to Br(µ− → e−γ) < 5.7 · 10−13 [38, 39]. The MEG-II
upgrade is expected to have suﬃcient sensitivity to re-
duce this upper bound by about one order of magnitude
[40]. Within the context of the SM, this process proceeds
through a W − ν loop, an example of which is shown in
Fig. 2. Including corrections from the massive neutrinos,
the result is Br(µ → eγ) = (3α/32π)δ2

which ends up being a much tighter constraint on the
mass parameters than the µ → eγ branching ratio. Var-
ious experiments, either running or in planning, project
to reduce the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude
[51, 52].

b. Lepton Universality

It is possible to reﬁne the
mass constraint on the new degrees of freedom, by uti-
lizing tests of lepton universality tests. There exist var-
ious standard decay channels to test lepton universality,
[45, 53, 54].
In particular, we will focus on τ decays,
through the Rτ observable deﬁned as
Γ(τ− → e−νν)
Γ(τ− → µ−νν)

Rτ =

eigenstates and Γ(τ− → e−νν) =(cid:80)

In the SM, because the neutrinos are massless, the ﬂavor
eigenstates νl and mass eigenstates νi coincide so that
Γ(τ− → e−νν) = Γ(τ− → l−ντ νl).
In a general set-
ting though, the masses are linear combinations of ﬂavor
i,j Γ(τ− → l−νiνj).
The Rτ ratio has recently been measured by the BaBar
collaboration, Rτ = 0.9796 ± 0.0016 ± 0.0036 [55], which
we will simply approximate as Rτ ≈ 1 ± ∆Rτ , with
∆Rτ = 0.0052. In general, decay rates have a somewhat
complex dependence on the various lepton and neutrino
masses [56],

In this expression, we have ignored small radiative cor-

simplify the analysis, we split the mN mass range into
5 regions, and take the function f to be equal to 0 or
1 depending on whether the decay channel is allowed.
Using unitarity, it will always be possible to express the
visible-visible mixing in terms of the visible-hidden mix-
l , since we
assumed Uli = Θl, with Nh the number of hidden ﬂavors.

For this particular light NP model, stronger sensitivity
actually comes from µ − e conversion in nuclei [47–49].
There are two transition channels for this process. First,
the photonic transition, through the same diagram as
the µ → eγ on-shell transition, except the photon is now
connected to the nucleus. The second, through the non-
photonic transition, which occurs either through Z-boson
exchange or a box diagram mediated by W -bosons. It
turns out the non-photonic transition is dominated by
the box diagram. Since we focus on the light neutrino
regime here, we utilize the result that the box diagram
receives a large enhancement in this regime compared to
the photonic transition, i.e. r = Γγ/Γγ ∼ 103 [47], and
the box diagram dominates the µ − e conversion rate.
The conversion rate compared to muon capture in the
nucleus, Rµ−e = Γ(µ − e)/Γcapture, is given by

limits on the light eigenstates, the decay rate depends
on meﬀ

tion could instead be due to heavier singlets unrelated to
neutrino oscillations, such as those considered above in
the context of lepton ﬂavor violation.

Utilizing the same neutrino model as in the previous
section, we recall that the heavy mass eigenstates Ni mix
with νe, and we can write the mass eigenstates as Ni =

with the sensitivity from LFV observables. LNV provides
a subleading constraint within this particular inverse see-
saw model, since the lepton number violating parameter
is  which is taken negligible compared to the other mass
parameters. However, more signiﬁcant sensitivity to the
mixing angle arises in the standard seesaw model, where
we enlarge the Majorana terms in the mass matrix. For
example, a recent analysis [65] of the current limits on
the half-lives of 76Ge and 136Xe obtained the constraints
|U 2
eN| < 10−8 − 10−6 as mN varies from 1 − 100 GeV.
These limits are more stringent than those from direct
searches (e.g. from Z decays) for mN > few GeV. That
analysis considers sterile neutrinos whose masses come
predominantly from the Majorana mass term.

[ML:The range of MD is bounded above by the requirement
to keep MD < mW , and from below to satisfy the 0νββ con-

the µ− e conversion constraint is by far the strongest, though
the τ → lνν becomes stronger at low .] [ML:Removed text]

plots are shown in Fig. 3. It is clear that this simple light
NP model can provide a natural interpretation for devia-
tions observed in µ → e conversion or lepton universality.

servable for L-violation, and the current limits [57–61] are

ited from the size of the Majorana mass term , which is
set by the constraint on the active neutrino mass squared
diﬀerences. Therefore, within this model it is not possible
to generate a sizeable EDM. However, a far larger EDM
is possible in a variant of this model with an extra visible-
hidden Dirac mass coupling m2. Namely, we switch gear

D. Electric dipole moments

Electric dipole moments (EDMs) provide an important
class of precision CP -odd observables. The only UV-
complete CP -odd mediation channel is via the neutrino
portal, and the phases in the Yukawa matrix YN , pro-
vided there are at least two singlet neutrinos Ni. These
phases can contribute to leptogenesis at high scales and
induce various CP -violating observables, but at a level
that is characteristically suppressed at low energy by the
neutrino masses. We will ﬁrst consider lepton EDMs
induced through this channel before turning to more
generic light NP mechanisms, and then turn to hadronic
EDMs which are distinct as they can be generated at or
close to the current level of sensitivity through the QCD
θ-term.

c. Paramagnetic (and leptonic) EDMs

In the SM
extended with massive neutrinos, it is possible to gener-
ate an EDM at the two-loop level [66–68], an example of
which is shown in Fig. 4. These diagrams can be shown
to scale as

trino mass eigenstates. Up to now, we have ignored the
possible CP -odd phases in this model. However, in gen-
eral not all the mass parameters are real. We choose
to leave the physical CP -odd phase in mD = |mD|eiη,
and for ease of writing, replace |mD| simply with mD.
Given that the mixing angles are mD/MD (cid:46) 0.1, we
see that the contribution from the diagram with two in-
ternal light neutrinos will be tiny, O(mν1mν2∆m2
21).
Thus, we need only look at the cases where either one
or two internal neutrinos are heavy, respectively called
the h − l or h − h contributions. Looking at the h − h
contribution, the mixing that enters is Γ+−, but both
U 2
e+ and U 2
e− have the same phase since they are con-
trolled by mD/MD. The CP -odd phase thus cancels
from the h− h contribution. Next, the h− l contribution

bound to ∼ 10−33e·cm, which is still much lower than the
current experimental upper limit de < 8.7 × 10−29e · cm
[69].

Taking a more general approach, we consider a more
complex light hidden sector. We introduce a Dirac
fermion ψ charged under U (1)V with CP -violating cou-
plings to the scalar singlet S [70–75],

LCP
hid = ¯ψiγµDV

(27)
µ = ∂µ − e(cid:48)qψVµ. This hidden sector CP -

violation can then be mediated to the SM via the CP -
even vector and Higgs portals.

Loops of ψ can induce the CP -odd hF ˜F vertex shown
in Fig. 5, which contributes to EDMs via Barr-Zee-type
diagrams for example. For simplicity, we assume that V
is parametrically lighter than S and ψ, so the EDM takes
the form (see e.g. [76])

which is still well below the current sensitivity to the
electron EDM [69]. The main constraint, as alluded to
above, is the need to ensure that mV is suﬃciently small
which limits the size of κ < 10−4.

Another contribution to the experimentally accessible
paramagnetic EDMs of atoms and molecules is the semi-
leptonic interaction CS ¯N N eiγ5e. This operator can also
be generated by through the hV ˜V vertex, and allows ac-
cess to a regime with larger mV for which the constraints
on κ are somewhat weaker. However, this contribution is
still not at a level that can approach the current exper-
imental sensitivity. Thus, at least within this restricted
class of hidden sectors, we conclude that paramagnetic
EDMs (and lepton EDMs) are in practice a probe of UV
new physics.

d. Diamagnetic (and hadronic) EDMs Hadronic
EDMs can also be induced using the same mechanism
as outlined above, using the hidden sector Bazz-Zee di-
agram, but as above this will necessarily be below the
current level of sensitivity. However, hadronic EDMs
can also be generated by the QCD θ-term, which is a
marginal operator [77–80]. The strongest current limits
in this sector are from the EDMs of the neutron and from
the Hg atom,

(33)

(34)

where the apparent strength of the Hg EDM bound is
tempered by Schiﬀ screening of the nuclear EDM. The
contribution of ¯θ to the neutron EDM is via the isoscalar
CP -odd pion nucleon coupling ¯g0(¯θ) ∼ 0.05¯θ,

[AR:Numerically, the ﬁnal kinetic mixing required to con-
vert the operator from a V -electric dipole moment to an
EDM is problematic, as it introduces signiﬁcant momen-
tum suppression unless 1/mV is smaller than the char-
acteristic atomic or molecular scale.
In particular, we
require mV < 1/(meαZ), and in this regime there are
strong constraints on κ through the impact of V -loops
on g− 2 of the electron. Inserting qψ = 1, α(cid:48) = α, ˜YS = 1

This leads to the current constraint on ¯θ < 10−10.
The contribution of ¯θ to dHg is more complex, and for
some time it appeared that it would be isospin sup-
pressed as the Schiﬀ moment was primarily sensitive to
¯g1(¯θ) ∼ 0.001¯θ rather than ¯g0(¯θ). However, more recent
analyses of the Hg Schiﬀ moment have indicated that ¯g0
may provide a comparable contribution to ¯g1. Taking the
current ‘best values’ indeed indicates that the dominant
contribution from ¯θ would be through ¯g0, and we have
dHg(¯θ) ∼ 5 × 10

0.05 × 10−10 + O(¯g1(¯θ))

This is a factor of 6 below the current bound, but given
that the precision of the calculation is generally under-
stood to be at the order of magnitude level, it is clear that
a nonzero detection of dHg could not unambiguously be
interpreted as a contribution of a source other than ¯θ.

γVVψγShγ5We conclude that at the current stage, nonzero detec-
tions for the dominant hadronic EDMs observables could
be explained without additional UV new physics, but
simply through new QCD physics in the form of ¯θ. Fur-
ther improvements in the sensitivity to dn could of course
change this picture.

]

E. Quark ﬂavour violation

We now turn to precision quark ﬂavour-violating ob-
servables, with the b → sγ transition as a benchmark.
There are a couple of features which clearly distinguish
these observables, with regard to the role of light new
physics. Firstly, since the RH states are charged, there is
no analogue of the neutrino portal, and thus no renormal-
izable ﬂavour violating interactions that do not involve
new charged states. Given the existing limits on new light
degrees of freedom which are charged, this almost auto-
matically puts quark ﬂavour violating observables into a
category that is sensitive to UV new physics only. The
second distinguishing feature is that the SM generally
provides non-negligible contributions to quark ﬂavour vi-
olation through the CKM matrix. Utilizing a W -boson
loop at leading order for example, the SM contributes to
Br( ¯B → Xsγ) = (3.60±0.30)·10−4 [83], while the BaBar
sensitivity is Br( ¯B → Xsγ) (cid:39) (3.15 ± 0.23) · 10−4 [84].
Thus, the sensitivity to new physics is also determined
by the precision of SM calculations.

Since these observables are not primarily sensitive to
light new physics in the categories that we have delin-
eated, we will not consider them in detail. However, it
is worth outlining how a model with low energy ﬂavour
violation can be realized, albeit one that still relies on ad-
ditional heavy charged states. We will consider a model
in which we gauge an anomaly-free U (1)(cid:48) combination of
quark ﬂavours, Qf 1 − Qf 2 [85, 86], with a diagonal (and
vectorial) gauge coupling of the form [87–90],

(cid:88)

LZ(cid:48) = gzZ

(cid:48)
µ

zf ¯qγµq,

(37)

q=Qf ,uf ,df

with e.g. zQ3 = zb = −zQ2 = −zs = 1. On transforming
to the mass eigenstate basis, this non-universal coupling
will generate a ﬂavour-violating b − s − Z(cid:48) vertex, and
mediate ﬂavour violating transitions.
In practice, this
imposes signiﬁcant constraints on the combinations of
gzzQ,b,s, and is usually used to motivate ﬂavour-universal
U (1)(cid:48) charge assignments. Here, we are interested in hav-
ing a light Z(cid:48) that can indeed mediate these transitions
at the level to which current experiments are sensitive.
If we assign integer charges, then a small gauge coupling
gz ∼ 10−5 will be suﬃcient for this purpose. As has

9
recently been emphasized [86], K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing requires
gz|zQ2 −zQ1| < 10−5MZ(cid:48)/(1 GeV), while B0− ¯B0 mixing
imposes similar constraints on gz|zQ3 − zQ1|. [AR:Better
refs?]

The gauging of ﬂavour-universal symmetries leads to
further model building requirements for the quark mass
spectrum, as the Yukawa matrices are now subject to
additional constraints. Additional charged Higgs ﬁelds
are required, which necessarily lie above the EW scale
given the current LHC constraints. Thus, while quark
ﬂavour-violation could be mediated via a light Z(cid:48), the
model would necessarily involve charged states above the
EW scale, and thus UV new physics.

F. Baryon number violation

New non-SM sources of baryon number violation, for
which the primary precision experiments are searches for
proton decay, necessarily require new UV physics. Since
the minimal baryonic vertex is irrelevant, the most fea-
sible way of introducing a low energy mediation mecha-
nism is to gauge B, introducing a U (1)B vector (see e.g.
[91]). Since B is anomalous, this necessarily requires the
introduction of new charged states, which fall into the
category of new UV physics in our classiﬁcation.

4. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have explored the sensitivity of pre-
cision observables to UV-complete models of light NP.
While it is common to automatically interpret preci-
sion measurements in terms of generic scenarios of new
physics at or above the electroweak scale, we have pointed
out that many of these observables are often most sim-
ply considered within models of weakly-coupled hidden
sectors. More precisely, we ﬁnd that the neutrino portal
allows for a description of many observables in the lep-
tonic sector. Only the observables that intrinsically in-
volve quark ﬂavour violation, baryon number violation,
or changes to the charged currents (and thus electroweak
symmetry breaking) seemingly allow an unambiguous in-
teroperation in term of new short-distance physics.
