We study the impact on leptogenesis of Higgs portal couplings to a new scalar singlet. These couplings
open up additional CP-violating decay channels for the higher mass singlet neutrinos N2 and N3. We
analyze the simplest case of two-level N1 − N2 leptogenesis, including significant mass hierarchies, in
which the CP asymmetry is generated in part by singlet-mediated decays of N2. For these models, provided
the lightest singlet neutrino N1 is sufficiently weakly coupled to avoid excessive washout, its mass scale is
not directly constrained by the Davidson–Ibarra bound.

I. INTRODUCTION

The discovery of neutrino oscillations [1], and thus small
neutrino masses [2], provides motivation for leptogenesis
[3–7] as a simple, and seemingly generic, mechanism for
producing the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe.
The simplest UV completions of
the dimension-5
Weinberg operator HLHL [8], which contribute to neutrino
masses, naturally incorporate heavy degrees of freedom
with allowed CP-violating couplings, of which the out-
of-equilibrium decay can generate a lepton asymmetry.
Standard Model (SM) sphaleron processes can then equili-
brate B − L above the weak scale, resulting in the required
late time asymmetry in baryon number [9].

Beyond the clear possibility to test the Majorana nature
of neutrinos through neutrinoless double beta decay [10],
the high-scale nature of leptogenesis—characterized for
example by the Davidson–Ibarra bound [11]—and the lack
of model-independent links between the high-scale and
low-scale manifestations of CP violation, renders the
mechanism feasible but hard to test [12]. This has moti-
vated continuing study of variations of this general frame-
work which may be placed under further experimental
scrutiny, particularly those that allow a lowering of the
scale (see e.g. Ref. [13]). This turns out to be quite difficult
for the basic reason that the asymmetries generated by
loop-level decays are counteracted by similar washout
processes from two-to-two scattering. Lowering the scale
at which the asymmetry is generated means a lower
Hubble expansion rate, and thus more scattering processes
will be in equilibrium and able to efficiently cancel the
asymmetry. The conclusion is that it becomes increasingly
difficult to find viable scenarios which operate at or close
to the weak scale; an exception is the case of resonant
decays [14].

From a theoretical perspective, the simplest realization of
leptogenesis, with heavy right-handed (RH), i.e. singlet,
Majorana neutrinos, involves one of the few renormalizable
interactions between the SM and a neutral hidden (or dark)

sector. The RH neutrino coupling is described by the
Langrangian

The class of UV complete relevant or marginal interactions
of the type characterized by λji, known as portals, is very
small. If we require no additional states, the list contains
this right-handed neutrino coupling, λ ¯NL · H; the coupling
to the Higgs, ðβS þ λS2ÞH†H; and
of a scalar singlet
kinetic mixing of a U(1) vector with hypercharge,
κVμνBμν. Since the coefficients of these operators are
unsuppressed by any heavy new physics scale, they are
a natural place to look for signs of new short-distance
physics. Couplings to a hidden sector are also motivated by
our other primary piece of empirical evidence for new
physics, namely dark matter, and thus these portals have
been the focus of considerable recent attention [15].

In this paper, we explore the minimal extension of
“standard” leptogenesis incorporating the Higgs portal
coupling, which is now subject
to direct experimental
probes at the LHC. The relevant and marginal interactions
then include

We have not shown the quartic Higgs portal coupling here
as it will not play a significant role, other than for the full
scalar potential, but have added the allowed Majoron
coupling αij between the scalar S and Ni. The ensuing
scenario for baryogenesis will be referred to as Higgs portal
leptogenesis (HPL).

As we discuss below, this minimal extension is sufficient
to open up new CP-violating decay channels for the
next-to-lightest singlet neutrino N2 (and N3). These new

channels also decouple the source of the CP asymmetry
from the seesaw contribution to the light neutrino mass.
Consequently, leptogenesis can be viable in a wider mass
range, and in particular when the lightest singlet neutrino is
very light, e.g. below the sphaleron threshold. To analyze
the impact of the new decay channels, we study the case of
two-level N1 − N2 leptogenesis in detail, paying attention
to the washout induced by scattering associated with N1
and the additional scalar. In minimal leptogenesis, these
two-to-two processes are generally negligible as the neu-
trino abundance is Boltzmann suppressed. This is not
necessarily the case for N2;1 scattering mediated by the
hidden sector, and washout would be problematic if N1
were in equilibrium for an extended period. Nonetheless,
we find that there are viable regions of parameter space in
which N1 is parametrically light, but also very weakly
coupled, in which the lepton asymmetry generated by N2
decays survives to provide the observed baryon abundance
(see e.g. Ref. [16]). The possibility of effectively decou-
pling N1 from its normally dominant role in leptogenesis,
and having it be parametrically light and experimentally
accessible [13,16], is one of the interesting features of HPL.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
we outline the model and determine the additional con-
tributions to the CP asymmetry from the hidden sector.
Since the hidden sector contributions enter only through the
decays of the next-to-lightest singlet neutrinos, in Sec. III
we turn to the Boltzmann evolution of the coupled N1 − N2
system and study in some detail the important role of
N1-mediated two-to-two scattering in washing out
the
N2-generated asymmetry. Section IV presents a number
of results for the final lepton asymmetry in different mass
regimes. The new hidden sector contributions to the CP
asymmetry are crucial in allowing a lowering of the overall
mass scale without violating the Davidson–Ibarra bound.
We conclude in Sec. V, while a series of Appendixes
contains further technical details.

II. HIGGS PORTAL AND THE CP ASYMMETRY

A. Model

Our focus in this paper will be a minimal extension of
conventional leptogenesis, which adds a scalar singlet S
along with the right-handed singlet neutrinos Ni. This
opens up the Higgs and neutrino portals and, significantly,
allows for a new CP-odd source in the hidden sector. CP
violation is of course a central ingredient in leptogenesis,
as it is in any theory of matter genesis according to the
Sakharov conditions [17]. The portal couplings in the
Lagrangian (2) include

The Higgs portal coupling β is one part of the full scalar
potential VðH; SÞ and necessarily breaks any S → −S
symmetry. Thus, determining the vacuum structure requires
a separate analysis incorporating thermal corrections. This
potential has been studied in detail elsewhere [18], and here
we simply assume that the parameters are chosen to ensure
viable electroweak symmetry breaking, and importantly
that hSi ¼ 0. The possibility of a more complex behavior of
hSi, which modifies the effective right-handed neutrino
(RHN) mass is nonetheless interesting and will be dis-
cussed further in the concluding section.

In minimal leptogenesis, the Yukawa couplings λ deter-
mine both the light neutrino mass spectrum and the CP
asymmetry generated in RH neutrino decays [19]. Opening
the Higgs portal allows these two physical phenomena to be
decoupled, with the Majoron coupling αij providing a new
CP-odd source that is unconstrained (for hSi ¼ 0) by the
light neutrino mass spectrum. In the Lagrangian (3), a
unitary rotation has been used to diagonalize the RH
neutrino mass matrix Mij → Miδij. The Majorana nature
of Ni ¼ Nc
i ensures that Mij is symmetric, and for n flavors
the diagonalization leaves Mi as n real mass eigenvalues
[20]. In general, the corresponding rotation simply rear-
ranges the nðn þ 1Þ=2 phases in the symmetric matrix αij,
which is thus a physical CP-odd source in addition to the
neutrino Yukawa λij.1

B. CP asymmetry

In leptogenesis, the CP asymmetry arises from RHN
decays to leptons, N → LH and N → ¯L ¯H, and is measured
by ϵi,

ϵi ≡ ΓðNi → LHÞ − ΓðNi → ¯L ¯HÞ

mass term Mij is forbidden, the matrix αij can be be made real
and diagonal.

Thus, at least for two-body decays, the CP asymmetry
requires loops and a phase in the loop function itself. In
standard leptogenesis, only the Yukawa λij allows for this
decay channel and can accommodate CP violation. In Higgs
portal leptogenesis, additional lepton number-violating and
CP-violating sources are present in the theory, specifically
the αij coupling as discussed above. As a result, additional
loop-induced decay channels open up, as displayed in Fig. 1.
The corresponding CP asymmetries will be discussed in
the following subsections. We use the Majorana Feynman
rules [21] for the RH neutrinos and determine the imagi-
nary parts of
the loop functions using the standard
Cutkosky rules [22].

to-last neutrino to be of the same chirality as the final
lepton, left handed. The functions IjLL and IjRL corre-
spond to the L-L-L and R-L-L chains respectively. The
reason why the chirality chains do not combine owes to
the fact that αij is neither real nor diagonal. In the vertex
contribution, there are three possible cuts which lead to an
imaginary part: cuts along the S=N lines, the H=S lines,
and the H=N lines, each of which contains the two
chirality chain contributions. Thus, each chirality chain
function, ImfIjLLg and ImfIjRLg, is the sum,

It will be convenient to graphically represent the inter-
ference terms in jMj2 which contribute to the imaginary
part in the form of bubble diagrams. For now we focus on
the N=S cut which is shown in Fig. 2 [the full set of cuts is
presented later in Fig. 4(a)]. The double line indicates
external lines that are on shell by definition in jMj2, in this
case the final lepton and Higgs, while the single line shows
the Cutkosky cut. According to the Cutkosky rules, the

The delta functions impose the on-shell condition for
the N=S lines, and the Heaviside functions Θ require these
on-shell lines to be physical (timelike) processes. In other
words, imposing positivity of the energies p0 − l0 − k0 and
k0 þ l0 requires that the cut diagram corresponds to the
decay Ni → NjS followed by the scattering NjS → LH.
Combining the energy constraints also restricts the indi-
vidual energies l0 ¼ Miðrji − σiÞ=2, and Mi=2 > l0 > −

Note that the N=S cut is divergent in the infrared limit
σi ¼ 0, where it is effectively equivalent to the decay Ni →
NjS followed by the scattering NjS → LH mediated by the
Higgs in the t channel. The divergence, due to radiating
massless scalars in the infrared collinear limit, is canceled
by including the appropriate three-body decays as dis-
cussed below.

Note that the infrared divergence at σi ¼ 0 has disappeared,
resulting from a cancellation between (13), (14), and (18).
A simple graphical understanding of this cancellation
emerges by comparing the N=S cut diagram of Fig. 4(a)
with the Nj-line cut diagram of Fig. 4(b). In general they
have different kinematics, but they coincide in the infrared
limit where all the internal lines of the respective diagrams
are allowed to be on shell, permitting the emission of soft
particles. The inclusion of the two-body and three-body
final-state contributions renders the CP asymmetry well
defined.
Note also that the contributions that are nonvanishing
only in the σi ¼ 0 limit; i.e. those coming from the H=S cut
in (15) and from the H-line cut in (18) also cancel out. This
can again be understood by comparing the H=S-cut
diagram of Fig. 4(a) and the H-cut of Fig. 4(b), for which
the kinematics are identical.

3. Wave-function corrections

Once again, because of the Majorana nature of the right-
handed neutrinos, there can be chirality mixing, leading to
the following four chirality chains in the right-hand dia-
gram of Fig. 1:

νRðRHÞ → νRðRHÞ → νC
νRðRHÞ → νC
RðLHÞ → νC
RðLHÞ → νRðRHÞ → νC
νC
RðLHÞ → νC
RðLHÞ → νC

RðLHÞ → LðLHÞ;
RðLHÞ → LðLHÞ;
RðLHÞ → LðLHÞ;
RðLHÞ → LðLHÞ:

ð22Þ

The two first chains contain only one chirality flip, the third
contains two flips, and the last contains none. Each chain
will be labeled by the chiralities of the two first lines in the
loop, i.e. the RR, RL, LR, and LL chains respectively. The
asymmetry then takes the following form:

prevents the lighter neutrino flavor, N1, from having
any CP-odd decays through the Higgs portal, since by
definition r21 > 1. Only the heavier flavors, N2;3, can
contribute to the CP asymmetry through the hidden sector
decays. For the remainder of this paper, we will generally
focus on the minimal case with two heavy neutrinos N1 and
N2, so that the hidden sector will play an important role
through the decays of N2. This presents us with the
interesting possibility of taking N1 parametrically light,
where it could have other phenomenological consequences.
At the same time, there is also the danger of significant
washout of the asymmetry by scattering processes medi-
ated by N1. We will discuss the latter issue in some detail in
subsequent sections.

The full CP asymmetry is obtained by combining the
above results for ϵv
i (23). For the hierarchical
N1 − N2 regime, with M2=M1 ≥ 10 that will be of interest
the CP asymmetry can be approximated by the

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 90, 096002 (2014)

III. TWO-STAGE BOLTZMANN EVOLUTION
In minimal leptogenesis, the RHN sector λijNjLiH þ
MiNiNi provides the ingredients for two of Sakharov’s
conditions to be satisfied; L is violated due to the presence
of both Mi and λij, while there are physical CP-odd phases
in λij. The third and final condition is satisfied dynamically
as the expansion of the Universe provides a mechanism
for L-violating processes to go out of equilibrium. For this
to happen, the rate ΓN of L-violating RHN decays must
fall below the Hubble expansion rate H. This transition is
controlled by the Gamow equilibrium parameter, K ¼
ΓN=HðT ¼ MÞ [23],2 where the Hubble rate HðT ¼ MÞ
sets the time scale, tH, at which the equilibrium density
becomes Boltzmann suppressed. Setting K < 1 ensures
the particle lifetime is longer than the Hubble time,
τN > tH, and an excess abundance develops. In that case,
the rate of decays will be large compared to that of inverse
decays in order for the neutrino abundance to be able to
reach equilibrium, effectively putting the system out of
equilibrium.

leptogenesis,

In Higgs portal leptogenesis, we require at least two
Majorana neutrinos, and there are two major implications.
On one hand, the CP asymmetry from N2 decays (25) is
enhanced for low masses and can in fact become the
dominant contribution. This suggests the possibility of
establishing a “lower energy” theory of
leptogenesis,
mainly controlled by N2 physics. On the other hand,
the two RHN flavors lead to a novel evolution in the total
lepton asymmetry. In minimal
the lepton
asymmetry is primarily generated in a temperature range
near the lightest RHN mass, T ∼ M1, since the decays
and scattering are out of equilibrium for lower temper-
atures. The difference here is that, even though most of
the lepton asymmetry can be generated through N2
decays and inverse decays at
temperatures around
T ∼ M2, the lighter neutrino flavor N1 potentially remains
in equilibrium and can mediate rapid washout of the N2-
generated asymmetry. These interactions will be studied
carefully below,

HPL is the possibility of having scattering processes in
equilibrium during the period that a CP asymmetry would
be generated through out-of-equilibrium decays. The most
significant are those L-violating scattering processes with
an external N1, the abundance of which is not Boltzmann
suppressed. The scattering processes that have an external
N2 are of course suppressed by the N2 abundance which
rapidly falls off exponentially. Among the scattering
processes that violate the lepton number by ΔL ¼ 1 units,
we include the scattering NiL↔Q¯t in the s channel and
NiQ↔Lt, Nt↔LQ in the t channel. From the hidden
sector, one includes the s-channel processes NiL↔HS
mediated by a Higgs, and NiS↔LH mediated by a
In the t channel, one has NiS↔LH and
neutrino.
NiH↔LS both mediated by a Higgs. A full treatment of
neutrino-mediated scattering is complicated because of the
λij and αij flavor structures. For simplicity, we will ignore
the flavor mixing in these processes with intermediate
neutrinos, e.g. σNiS↔LH ¼
LH, and assume the
processes are dominated by one flavor. This is sufficient for
order-of-magnitude estimates. Note that, because of the αij
coupling, we need to include interactions
such as
NiNj↔HH mediated by S in the s channel, which can
efficiently deplete the neutrino abundance, and in turn
affect the lepton asymmetry washout [24].3
As for the ΔL ¼ 2 interactions, one has LH↔LH
mediated by a neutrino in the s channel and LL↔HH,
LL↔HH mediated by a neutrino in the t channel. We start
by describing the Boltzmann equations for the lepton
asymmetry, which are the most complex, and then review
the neutrino abundance and the general features. Further
technical details are contained in Appendixes B and C.
Note that this work is concerned with the main dynamical
features of the model presented above, focussing on the
impact of the Higgs portal couplings. Thus, in deriving the
Boltzmann equations, we study only the total
lepton
asymmetry, ignoring the often significant effects on indi-
vidual lepton flavors [25]. For our purposes, it will also be
sufficient to use the CP asymmetries calculated within
zero-temperature field theory, although real-time thermal
field theory provides a more complete formalism; see
e.g. Ref. [26].

1. Lepton asymmetry

Starting with the lepton asymmetry equation, we have

2We will

follow the literature and denote the Hubble-
normalized N decay rate as K, while the modified Bessel
function that generically appears in the thermal
rates will
consistently be written as KiðzÞ, distinguished by the extra
argument z ¼ M=T.

3In the context of standard leptogenesis, ΔN ¼ 2 interactions,
e.g. N1N1 → HH mediated by a lepton in the t channel, are
negligible since they scale as λ4 which is suppressed for
M1 ≲ 1015 GeV.

exception when dealing with the subtracted rates as
discussed below.

be on shell for a sufficiently high center-of-mass energy.
The real intermediate state represents the physical process
LH → Nj → LH. However, these processes are already
accounted for by decays and inverse decays and therefore
need to be removed. Similarly, N1S→2LH has the real
intermediate
also
accounted for by decays and inverse decays. As it turns
out, the t-channel process NiH → LS also contains a real
intermediate state, that needs to be removed. This point is
explained in Appendix C, where explicit formulas for the
cross sections are displayed. For simplicity, all quarks and
leptons, as well as the Higgs and scalar S, are considered
massless. This can be justified because leptogenesis
necessarily occurs at temperatures above sphaleron decou-
pling, T > Tsphaleron ∼ 160 GeV > mH [27], though typi-
cally we shall take M2 > 1 TeV. The singlet S mass is not
yet stringently constrained, provided the Higgs portal
coupling is not too large [28], but we will typically take
it to be of the same order as the Higgs mass. With these
the t-channel processes NiQ↔Lt and
simplifications,
Nit → LQ have equal rates, and similarly for NiH →
LS and NiS → LH, which explains the factor of “2” sitting
in front of these processes in Eq. (26) above.

2. Subtracted rates and real intermediate states

In this subsection, we summarize the procedure used to
account for real intermediate states. The source terms in the
Boltzmann equations are systematically expanded in each
of the couplings, and one needs to avoid double counting
the RIS contributions that appear in (naively) higher order
scattering processes. Doing this consistently in standard
leptogenesis requires the inclusion of all processes up to
and including two-to-three scattering and the associated CP
asymmetries [29]. For HPL, we will do the same, extending
the analysis to account for real intermediate states coupling
via both the Yukawa λij and the singlet αij interactions. The
relevant
tree-level diagrams are displayed in Fig. 5,

λ order by order to avoid double counting, as discussed in the text.

although it is important to account also for loop corrections
that contribute to the CP asymmetries in scattering. As
already mentioned, we will focus on the impact of the
additional singlet decay channel and ignore the issue of

neutrino flavor mixing in scattering amplitudes, e.g.
LH→LH ¼

elsewhere. The RIS calculation of the s-channel cross
sections is generally a nontrivial
task once the flavor
structure is taken into account. However, given this
simplifying assumption, we can use the result γsub ¼ γ −
γon-shell [30].

To proceed to discuss the subtracted rates, we first make

the following definitions associated with N2 decays:

The need to include all these varied contributions to
obtain the correct Boltzmann equations should not come as
a surprise. Since there are two N2 decay channels, when-

can write down an additional scattering diagram which has
the N2 → N1S → LH decay chain as a subdiagram.

constants. In this paper, we also consider the set of interactions
involving the coupling β. However, among the set of
scatterings one considers, there is no additional real inter-
mediate state from this source, and we can directly rewrite the
Boltzmann equation for the final lepton asymmetry as

4. Physical regimes

The underlying dynamics of this system is in the end
quite similar to the simpler system which only accounts for
decays and inverse decays (plus RIS contributions), which
will be discussed in Sec. III B. At first sight it is surprising
the two-to-two scattering processes involving N1,
that
which can remain in equilibrium after N2 decays, do not
have a more significant role in washing out the asymmetry.
Indeed,
this intuition is realized if the couplings are
sufficiently large as will be seen in the next section.
However, there are natural parameter regimes in which
the rates involving N1 which change lepton number can be
out of equilibrium while the rates that change the number

FIG. 7. A list of the decay and scattering processes included in our Boltzmann equations. This list is not exhaustive, though it includes
the dominant contributions. In the limit where the quarks, Higgs, and singlet S are massless, the t-channel diagrams are counted twice
since it is possible to swap Q − t and H − S.

(2) The intermediate phase:

Given a sizeable mass hierarchy between N1 and
N2, the second phase is marked by a large temper-
ature gap once N2 has effectively disappeared and
before N1 interactions come into equilibrium. Nei-
ther N2 nor N1 interactions are able to affect the
lepton asymmetry, or the N1 abundance, and the
system effectively free streams leading to a plateau
in YL− ¯L. This phase lasts for as long as the N1
interactions remain out of equilibrium, and charac-
teristically for a temperature range similar to the
mass ratio. For example, if the decays and inverse
decays dominate, the approximations discussed in
Appendix B indicate that
the phase ends when
z1 ∼
. If scattering effects are also signifi-
cant, then the transition to the N1 phase can occur
somewhat earlier.

(3) The N1 phase:

This phase is marked by N1 interactions being in
equilibrium which efficiently deplete the neutrino
abundance and lepton asymmetry. Assuming again a
sizeable mass hierarchy, since the N2 abundance is
negligible and N2 interactions are effectively turned
off, D2; D21 ≪ D1,
the dynamics again approxi-
mates a purely one-flavor system. The distinction
is that the initial
lepton asymmetry is not zero,
having been generated in the N2 phase, and there is a
possible N1 overabundance Y1 > Yeq
1 due to N2 →
N1S decays during the first phase. The final lepton
asymmetry results from the competition between
N1-mediated processes that wash out the preexisting
lepton asymmetry from the N2 phase and those at the
end of the N1 phase that contribute to the asymme-
try. The result can again be parametrized via an
efficiency factor κ1,

they are out of
equilibrium, i.e. D1 ≪ D2; D21. In this case, the
physics of this phase is almost that of a one-flavor
system: the lepton asymmetry is generated through
N2 decays to leptons until
the N2 abundance
becomes negligible. A second subdominant process
can still be important, namely the mixing N2 − N1
that allows decays and inverse decays N2↔N1S if
α12 is sufficiently large. Because of this channel, the
branching ratio of N2 into leptons is reduced as
compared to the one-flavor system, making the
production of the lepton asymmetry less efficient.
At the same time, this very channel populates N1,
which is then kicked out of equilibrium momen-
tarily. Its ability to return to equilibrium depends on
the rate of the inverse decay N1S → N2, as the
decays N1 → LH are generally out of equilibrium in
this phase. The overpopulation of N1 is not very
important during this phase but will have an effect
on the lepton asymmetry at the later stage when N1
decays come into equilibrium. The resulting primary
lepton asymmetry can be parametrized by an effi-
ciency factor κ2,

B. Toy model of the two-stage evolution

In this subsection,

in order to isolate some of the
dominant physical effects, we study a toy model of the
two-level Boltzmann equations, accounting only for decays
and inverse decays and ignoring the impact of two-to-two
scattering. For simplicity, we also take the CP asymmetry
to be constant, using ϵ1 ¼ ϵ2 ¼ 10−8, although this con-
straint will be relaxed toward the end of the section. The
Boltzmann equations are as written in Eqs. (46) and (51), of

K2 ≫ 1 regime is similar to a one-flavor case, and the
coupling N2 − N1 does not have a large effect. Thus, we
can refer to the established literature [5] for an approximate
expression for κ2 in this region,

owing to the initial condition Y2ð0Þ ¼ Yeqð0Þ. Taking the
limit K21 ≪ K2, the equations decouple in such a way that
Y1 ∼ Yeq
1 , and the second term above is subdominant
leading to the efficiency factor,

ð62Þ

In the decoupled limit, the efficiency factor logically tends
to the one-flavor value. If instead we take the limit
K21 ≫ K2, the second term becomes significant, if not
dominant, and we have to integrate the equations explicitly.
In this limit, the branching ratio of N2 into leptons is small,
so that D21 ≫ D2. At the same time, D21 ≫ D1 in the
N2 phase. As a result,
the Y1;2 equations simplify to
∂Y2=∂z1 ¼ −∂Y1=∂z1, so that the total number density
Y1 þ Y2 is constant. This makes sense, since N2’s decay
dominantly into N1’s. We thus find,

will be those in which N1 is sufficiently weakly coupled
that the most dangerous effect, rapid washout via N1-
mediated inverse decays and two-to-two scattering,
is
suppressed. With this constraint, the residual effects of
scattering are generally quite small.

IV. RESULTS IN THE HIERARCHICAL REGIME

The focus in this section will be on studying the solutions
to the Boltzmann equations in the hierarchical regime,
M2=M1 ≫ 1. As shown in Fig. 16(a) in Appendix A, the
exact and large M2=M1 expressions for the CP asymmetry
are within a factor of 2 for M2=M1 > 10, which will serve
as a practical definition of this regime. Qualitatively, the
physical behavior should be similar for all mass ratios
outside the resonant regime [14], M2 − M1 ∼ Γ1;2=2, which
we will not consider here.

least

The two-flavor HPL model is distinct from standard
leptogenesis in at
two ways. The first difference
concerns the mass dependence of the CP asymmetry. As
discussed in Sec. II, and again in Appendix A, the CP
asymmetry presents distinct high and the low-mass
regimes. The high-mass regime, M2 ≳ 108 GeV, is deter-
mined by the standard Yukawa contribution to the CP
asymmetry. The low-mass regime is instead determined by
the hidden sector contribution to the CP asymmetry,
proportional to the trilinear coupling β=Mi. This liberates
the model from the Davidson–Ibarra bound on the CP
asymmetry and allows for viable low-scale scenarios.

The other significant difference with standard lepto-
genesis concerns the dynamics. In the minimal model, the
main contribution to the CP asymmetry comes from the
decays and inverse decays into leptons, and the scattering
processes are largely subdominant. This is in part because
as the temperature falls below T ∼ M1, all the L-violating
scattering rates are suppressed due to Boltzmann suppres-
sion of the neutrino abundance. For HPL, the situation is
different due to the emphasis on the CP asymmetry
generated by N2 decays and the importance of the evolution
between T ∼ M2 and T ∼ M1. As a consequence, scattering
processes involving N1 have the potential to affect the
lepton asymmetry quite significantly and need to be
considered carefully.

A. Viable scenarios

We will impose two requirements on realistic scenarios,
namely the ability to reproduce the observed baryon
asymmetry, and similarly that they admit a consistent light
neutrino mass spectrum. The first requirement translates
within leptogenesis to a specific lepton asymmetry at the
temperature where B þ L-violating sphaleron processes
fall out of equilibrium. For the Standard Model field
content, the equilibrated lepton and baryon asymmetries
are related by ηL ¼ −ð51=28ÞηB.The additional singlet in
the Higgs portal model only affects this by changing the

critical temperature of the electroweak crossover. Since we
assume hSi ¼ 0, then at least for relatively weak H − S
mixing the impact should be small [31]. We therefore
require jηLj ≃ 1 × 10−9, given the Planck result for Ωbh2
[32], which translates to the baryon-to-photon ratio ηB ≃
ð6.04  0.09Þ × 10−10 [33].

differences,

e.g. Δm2

For the second requirement, since the seesaw mecha-
nism is a motivating factor for leptogenesis, we also
require consistency with current data on the mass
1 ≃ ð7.5 
squared
0.5Þ × 10−5 eV2 [2]. The seesaw mechanism determines
an effective light neutrino mass ~mi ∼ λ2

can trade for the thermal equilibrium parameters Ki ¼

this relation relies on the equality ~mi ≃ mi between the

effective and the physical light neutrino masses, which
only holds when the neutrino flavor structure is nearly
diagonal [24]. More generally, the precise relation can be
relaxed, so we will consider models to be viable if the
interactions are in the range K2 ∼ Oð1–10Þ.

In the rest of this subsection, we present example
scenarios that satisfy the above constraints on the neutrino
masses and the lepton asymmetry. For each case we present
three figures: (i) the Boltzmann evolution of the neutrino
abundances and the lepton asymmetry; (ii) the relevant
thermal rates of decays, inverse decays, and scattering; and
finally (iii) the CP-asymmetry “landscape” in which the
theory is situated. In the following subsection, we provide
further details showing the impact of varying the param-
eters of the theory, while relaxing the constraints imposed
here on viable models. In particular, we show that the
dynamics of the high-mass regime is most sensitive to
fK1; K2g, whereas the low-mass dynamics responds
to fK2; K1; α; βg.

It is useful to distinguish “high” and “low” mass regimes,
based primarily on the mass dependence of the N2 CP
asymmetry. We focus below on the relative impact of two-
to-two scattering processes, compared to the toy model
discussed above.

(i) High-scale models

An example of a high-scale scenario is shown in
Fig. 11(a). The high-mass regime is marked by the

standard Yukawa contribution, ϵi ∝ mνMi=v2, and the final plot (c) displays the CP asymmetries ϵ1;2 as functions of M2, for a constant
mass ratio, M2=M1 ¼ 104. With a large mass hierarchy, there would be plenty of time for N1-mediated processes to wash out all of the

NiS→jLH scale as jαj2jλj2 and are therefore sup-

scenarios we consider here. The lepton-number
conserving scattering process NiNi → HH, medi-
ated by S in the s channel, scales as jαj2β2=M2 and is
again suppressed. Finally, the lepton-mediated t-

A feature worth noting is the sensitivity to low-
temperature boundary conditions, namely the temperature
at which B þ L-violating sphaleron transitions go out of
equilibrium, Tsphaleron ¼ 159  1 GeV [27]. The lepton
asymmetry at this point effectively determines the final
baryon asymmetry, while further evolution is observatio-
nally relatively unconstrained. This is phenomenologi-
cally interesting as it

viable models with a large washout from N1. However, if

sector

decouples in this case. A low-mass example is shown
in Fig. 13. Note that Tsphaleron > M1 > mH in this case,
since M1 < mH would require the inclusion of inter-
actions such as N1L↔H, that have not been considered
thus far.4 In the low-mass regime, many interactions are
relevant which cause significant washout of the lepton
asymmetry. As a consequence, the range of parameters
available for low-mass scenarios is quite limited. On the
other hand, an example of a high-mass scenario which
also takes advantage of the sphaleron cutoff temperature is
shown in Fig. 13(b). In that situation, all of the lepton
asymmetry is generated out of the first phase, from N2
leptonic decays. In this case, with M1 < Tsphaleron,
the
physics of N1, including the hidden sector interactions,
are only weakly constrained. An interesting aspect of this
scenario is the possibility of exploring models where the
lightest RH neutrino is so light and weakly coupled to
leptons that its lifetime could be long enough to play an
independent cosmological role, potentially in the form of
sterile neutrino dark matter [34]. In such cases, the N1
abundance will have to be sufficiently depleted for con-
sistency with constraints on the dark matter abundance. This
can be achieved through adjusting the N1N1 → HH rate.

B. Aspects of the dynamics

In this subsection, we relax some of the constraints
required for physical scenarios and focus on the various
dynamical components that come into play: the decays and
scattering processes on one hand, and the various param-
eters on the other.

1. Decays and inverse decays vs scattering

The impact of the decays, inverse decays, and scattering
is summarized in Fig. 14. We overlay three solutions:

corrections to the scalar masses.

Starting with the high-mass regime, the hidden sector

subdominant compared to the Yukawa-mediated processes
since β=Mi ≪ mt=v. This can be seen from Fig. 14(a),
where ΔL ¼ 1 scattering has a significant effect relative to
decays, whereas the ΔN ¼ 2 scatterings have no visible
effect. In practice, the decays and inverse decays remain the
dominant effect, and the results from Sec. III B can be

The low-mass regime is marked instead by the signifi-
cant, if not dominant, effect of hidden sector scattering
processes, given β=Mi ∼ mt=v. Looking at
in
Fig. 14(b), the effect of adding ΔL ¼ 1 scattering is similar
to that in the high-mass regime; however, the impact of
ΔN ¼ 2 processes is greatly enhanced. Although these
processes do not violate lepton number, ΔL ¼ 0, they act to
maintain the neutrino abundance closer to equilibrium. As a
consequence, both the ΔL ¼ 1 processes (e.g. decays) and
inverse decays) remain in
the inverse processes (e.g.
equilibrium for longer,
leading to an enhanced lepton
washout in that regime.

2. Parameter dependence

The dependence of the dynamics on the parameters is
displayed in Fig. 15. The subsection above considered
examples of viable models that satisfy the basic constraints
and focused on constraining the relevant parameters
accordingly. We now ignore those constraints and instead
vary the parameters fK2; K1; K21; βg to study their impact
in both high- and low-mass regimes.

(i) fK2; K1g: Figures 15(a) and 15(b) exhibit the effects
of K2 and K1 in the large mass regime. When the N1
and N2 phases can be hierarchically separated, they
both act as independent one-flavor systems accord-
ing to the respective efficiency factors κ1;2. Con-
sequently, we expect little deviation from the toy
model that was studied previously.

Figures 15(c) and 15(d) exhibit the effects of K2
and K1 in the low-mass regime. This regime requires
a smaller mass ratio to achieve sufficient CP
asymmetry; therefore, the overlap of the N2 and
N1 phases induces more intricate dynamics, though
we observe that the impact of K2 and K1 can still be
separated.
(ii) fK21; βg: Figures 15(e) and 15(f) exhibit the effects
of varying K21 and β in the low-mass scale regime.
The primary effect is on the magnitude of the lepton
asymmetry, via the impact on the CP asymmetry of
N2. However, there are also effects due to scattering.
Indeed, in both cases the maximal lepton asymmetry
is achieved for mid-range values, K21 ¼ 500 and
β ¼ 500 GeV respectively. This illustrates the fact
increasing these
that, beyond a given threshold,
parameters increases the scattering washout more
significantly which more than compensates for the
increase in the CP asymmetry.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

This paper has considered a minimal extension of
leptogenesis that arises by opening up the Higgs portal
with a new singlet scalar. This scalar can also couple at the
renormalizable level to the RH neutrinos, which introduces
a new (hidden sector) source of CP violation into the

theory. The new RHN decay channels that are opened allow
Higgs portal leptogenesis to avoid the stringent constraints
the Davidson–Ibarra bound, with viable low-scale
of
scenarios that we have considered in detail. The new decay
channels are only available for the next-to-lightest RH
neutrinos, which has a number of interesting implications

for phenomenology. We conclude in this section by
mentioning a number of these as directions for future work.
(i) First-order leptogenesis: The new decay channels,
e.g. N2 → N1 þ S, do not violate lepton number.
Thus, this model falls into a general category in
which the next-to-lightest RH neutrinos have both

096002-24

LEPTOGENESIS AND THE HIGGS PORTAL

L-violating and L-conserving decays. As has re-
cently been emphasized [35], such models allow the
original Weinberg–Nanopoulos theorem [36] to be
evaded in that the loop-level amplitude can be of
first-order in the L-violating vertex. This is clear
from the analysis in Sec. II, and thus the HPL model
is a simple example illustrating this general feature.
(ii) Light (CP-violating) sterile neutrinos: Since the new
sources of the CP asymmetry arise from decays of
the next-to-lightest RH neutrino states, it is possible
to effectively decouple N1 from leptogenesis. In-
deed, since the normal hierarchy still allows one
parametrically light (or massless) active neutrino, we
can consider taking N1 to be, for example, in the
keV mass range for sterile neutrino dark matter. It
would be interesting to explore whether the washout
constraints on the interactions allow for viable
thermal production modes in the early Universe. It
is notable that, since αij contains multiple CP-odd
phases, this model would generically imply some
new low energy contributions (albeit suppressed) to
CP-violating observables.

(iii) Dynamical seesaw scale: We assumed throughout
that the scalar S was in a stable vacuum throughout
the range of cosmological evolution relevant for
leptogenesis. This need not be the case, and the full
scalar potential VðH; SÞ could allow for some
evolution in hSi, which would in turn affect the
RH neutrino mass scale. Some of these issues were
recently considered in Ref. [24], and it would be
interesting to explore the implications of having an
early epoch where, for example, the RH neutrino
mass scale would pass through zero due to a phase
transition in the scalar potential.5

APPENDIX A: PARAMETRIZATION

OF THE CP ASYMMETRY

The focus of this paper is on the dynamics of the
Boltzmann evolution for HPL and the dependence on
the masses and mass ratios. Therefore, rather than working
with the full CP asymmetries computed in Sec. II, in this
Appendix we will derive an order-of-magnitude estimate
that will be more convenient to use in exploring the full
evolution. To this end, we replace the coupling constants by
their magnitudes, enabling components from the different

us an absolute upper bound on the asymmetries.

The final approximation assumes all the entries of the
orthogonal matrix R are similar in magnitude. When R is
real, the orthogonality condition RTR ¼ 1 ensures that its
elements satisfy Rij ≤ 1. When R is complex, we have
fewer constraints, but bounding jRijj by unity is a sufficient
condition for orthogonality, and to obtain a characteristic
estimate below, we will simply assume jRijj ∼ 1.
Because of kinematic constraints, we have ϵ1 ¼ 0. For
i ¼ 2, the neutrino sum runs over j ¼ 1; 3. However, the
asymmetry vanishes when j ¼ 3, since M3 > M2 is kin-
ematically forbidden for the cut loop. The sum thus reduces
to j ¼ 1 only. For the wave-function corrections, we have

two sums over j; l ¼ 1; 3. The index j denotes the neutrino
inside the loop and is therefore constrained to j ¼ 1 by the
cut kinematics, but l ¼ 3 is not forbidden. However, by
assumption r32 ≫ 1, and in that limit the resulting CP
asymmetry is negligible. The sums therefore collapse to
j ¼ l ¼ 1. Hence, we arrive at the parametric estimate,

parameters Ki→mn ¼ hΓi→mni=HðTÞ for the decay rate, and
similarly Kia→mn ¼ neq
i hvσia→mni=HðTÞ for the scattering
processes. It turns out that the thermal equilibrium param-
eters are related to the decay and scattering functions D; S,

Note that alternative definitions appear in the literature. For
example, the decay function D in Ref. [5] corresponds here
to Di→mn=ziYeq
i . The difference is a consequence of the
present need to consider two-level leptogenesis. In Ref. [5],
only terms of the form 1=Yeq
appear in the Boltzmann
i
equations, since only one RHN flavor is accounted for.
Instead, we take into account scattering processes with
external states mixing several RHN flavors, leading to terms
i Þ2. In addition, the definition zi ¼
like 1=Yeq

2 or ð1=Yeq

1 Yeq

mi=T explicitly brings in an arbitrary choice of reference
mass scale, mi. Therefore, we choose to keep the left-hand
side of the Boltzmann equations in the form zi∂Yi=∂zi in
order for it to be independent of that choice. Therefore,
removing the ziYeq
from the definition of the decay functions
i
seems more appropriate to the present case.

2. Example with leptonic RHN decay

To be specific, we will consider how these formulas
apply to the case of leptonic RHN decays and inverse
decays, Ni↔LH, directly relevant for leptogenesis. In
equilibrium, we have

Of course, it is a matter of convention to use 1=Yeq
L rather
than 1=Yeq
H in the definition of the thermal equilibrium
parameter for inverse decays. These two functions have
been plotted in Fig. 18(a) for various parameters KNi→LH.
The equilibrium conditions for the decays and inverse
decays are given as KNi→LH > 1 and KLH→Ni > 1 respec-
tively. The first condition translates to a restriction on
zi > zd, while the second translates to the condition
zþ
id. The solutions zd and z
id > zi > z−
id have been numeri-
cally solved and plotted in Fig. 18(b).

which is not generally true because of the complex phases
contained in α, but
the CP-odd contributions are not
relevant here as the decay is L conserving.

These processes involve the SM quarks and leptons in

external states.

(ii) t channel: We consider NiQ↔Lt and Nit↔LQ.
Because the leptons and quarks are assumed mass-
less, these two channels are in fact equal. We have

Throughout this paper, we take the approximation that the
zero-temperature Higgs mass mh ¼ 0, but in this limit,
these cross sections are infrared divergent. The regulator to
use, however, is the thermal mass which can potentially
be quite large at leptogenesis temperatures. In practice,
the cross section is only logarithmically sensitive to the
regulator, and we therefore make the conventional choice
mh=Mi ¼ 10−5.

these processes will almost always be divergent, as they include the kinematic regime where the RH neutrino decays
on shell to LH. It is therefore important to note that the cross section is regulated by the external neutrino decay
width. This subtlety has been noted previously in a different context [42]. Starting with NiH → LS, the amplitude

Upon integration over the transfer momentum, the second term leads to a logarithmic divergence. The first term is
naively more problematic because it leads to a linear divergence, 1=Ei. However, in the narrow width limit, upon
integration this term gives the delta function δðtÞ. This is the signature of an on-shell mediator, which splits the
scattering into the two on-shell subprocesses N → LH followed by HH → S. The first part is already accounted for
in the Boltzmann equations and should be subtracted in order to avoid double counting [43]. In effect, this is a

t-channel RIS. The subtracted scattering cross section we use is then
