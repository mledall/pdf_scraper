We study the analytic structure of partial-wave amplitudes derived from u- and t-channel exchange
processes. The latter plays a crucial role in dispersion-theory approaches to coupled-channel systems that
model final state interactions in QCD. A general spectral representation is established that is valid in the
presence of anomalous thresholds, decaying particles or overlapping left-hand and right-hand cut structures
as it occurs frequently in hadron physics. The results are illustrated at hand of ten specific processes.

I. INTRODUCTION

It

is still an open challenge to derive final state
interactions from QCD based on effective field theory
approaches at energies where the strong interaction forms
resonances. From the phenomenology of the last decades, it
is known that coupled-channel unitarity together with the
microcausality condition play a decisive role in the enter-
prise to unravel the underlying physics of this nonpertur-
bative domain of QCD (see e.g. [1–14]).

While final state interactions close to an elastic threshold
can be treated quite reliably in perturbation theory based on
a suitable chiral Lagrangian this is not so for energies where
the resonance spectrum is observed. A convenient frame-
work to study final state interactions is based on the concept
of a generalized potential. A partial-wave scattering ampli-
tude TabðsÞ with a channel index a and b for the final and
the initial state, respectively, is decomposed into contribu-
tions from left- and right-hand cuts where all left-hand cut
contributions reside in the generalized potential UabðsÞ. For
an approximated generalized potential the right-hand cuts
are induced by means of the nonlinear integral equation

where ρcdðw2Þ is a channel dependent phase-space func-
tion. By construction any solution of (1) does satisfy the
coupled-channel s-channel unitarity condition. While the
general framework is known from the 1960s [15–22], only
recently has this framework been successfully integrated
into an effective field theory approach based on the chiral
Lagrangian. The main additional and novel
idea is to
approximate the generalized potential systematically by

means of a conformal expansion that is reliable not only
near the threshold but also in the resonance region. The key
observation is that in (1) the generalized potential is needed
only in the region where the partial-wave amplitude has its
right-hand cuts. In this region a conformal expansion is
reliable and systematic results can be expected. Since the
expansion point for the conformal map can be dialed to lie
within the convergence domain of strict chiral perturbation
theory, the expansion coefficients may be computed from
the chiral Lagrangian. First applications of this novel
approach can be found in [10–14,23].

is straightforward to unravel

The conformal expansion of the generalized potential
requires the detailed knowledge of the spectral representa-
tion of the generalized potential, the main target of the
present work. The results of the following study are
indispensable for the analytic extrapolation of the gener-
alized potential into the resonance region. The analytic
continuation of a function requires a thorough understand-
ing of its branch points and lines [24]. The latter lead to its
spectral representation. While for reactions involving stable
particles it
the spectral
representation of the generalized potential [25,26], this is
not so for reactions involving, for instance, the nonet of
vector mesons with JP ¼ 1−
or the baryon decuplet states
with JP ¼ 3
þ. The latter play a crucial role in the hadro-
genesis conjecture that expects the low-lying resonance
spectrum of QCD light with up, down and strange quarks
only to be generated by final state interactions of the lowest
SU(3) flavor multiplets with JP ¼ 0−; 1−
þ
þ; 3
[6–9,27–33]. The coupled-channel
interaction of such
degrees of freedom leads to a plethora of subtle phenom-
ena, which need to be treated carefully. The left- and right-
hand cuts may overlap and the generalized potential may be
singular at threshold kinematics. The latter leads to an
anomalous threshold behavior of the partial-wave scatter-
ing amplitudes. This may occur at a threshold but also at a

The work is organized as follows. In Secs. II and III the
framework for a dispersion-integral
representation of
partial-wave amplitudes is set up, and general results are
derived. Detailed illustrations are offered with specific
t-channel and u-channel diagrams in Sec. IV. We conclude
with a short summary in Sec. V.

II. PARTIAL-WAVE PROJECTION OF INVARIANT

SCATTERING AMPLITUDES

A general scattering amplitude Tð¯k; k; wÞ will have a
decomposition into a set of invariant amplitudes Fnðs; t; uÞ
and associated tensors Lnð¯k; k; wÞ that carry possible Dirac
and Lorentz structure of the scattering amplitude. The latter
is required for reactions of particles with nonvanishing
spin. We write

Tð¯k; k; wÞ ¼

Fnðs; t; uÞLnð¯k; k; wÞ;
u ¼ ðp − ¯qÞ2;

n

t ¼ ðp − qÞ2;

ð2Þ
s ¼ ðp þ qÞ2;
where we insist on invariant amplitudes, Fnðs; t; uÞ, that are
free of kinematical constraints [34–36]. Owing to energy
and momentum conservation the scattering amplitude
Tð¯k; k; wÞ depends on three 4-vectors ¯kμ; kμ and wμ only

where λðJPÞ

are derived in the literature for any given angular momen-
tum J and parity P (see e.g. [37–43]). In (4) we consider
Fnðs; t; uÞ as functions of s and the cosine of the scattering
angle x ¼ cos θ. The main target of this work is the
derivation of a spectral representation for such partial-wave
amplitudes.
According to the hypothesis of Mandelstam [16], the
amplitudes Fnðs; t; uÞ satisfy dispersion integral repre-
sentations characterized by a set of spectral weight
functions,

such a decomposition
has been worked out explicitly for various reactions
[35,37–41].

In the literature,

The partial-wave scattering amplitudes are given by

appropriate projection integrals,

as can be confirmed in perturbation theory. In effective
field theory applications, suitable subtractions may be
required. In this work we focus on the contributions
defined by the t- and u-channel spectral weights ρðnÞ
t ð¯tÞ
and ρðnÞ
u ð ¯uÞ. They give rise to so-called left-hand cuts in
the partial-wave scattering amplitudes. The s-channel
contribution ρðnÞ
s ð¯sÞ gives rise to s-channel unitarity cuts
which are referred to as right-hand cuts.

In a first step we will establish a spectral representation
for a generic t-channel and u-channel term as shown in

A few comments on the representation (6) are in order.
The integral on the left-hand side of (6) defines an analytic
function in s with branch points at s ¼ 0 and s ¼ cðuÞ
 ðmuÞ.
Here we assume that the x-integration contour in (4) is
appropriately deformed into the complex plane to avoid the
situation u½s; x ¼ m2
t with x ≠ 1. It is
convenient, though not mandatory, to define the branch cuts
connected to the endpoint singularities of (6), i.e. the points
cðtÞ
 ðm2
uÞ, to lie on the lines defined by the
functions cðtÞ
 ðm2Þ. This procedure has the
advantage that t- and u-channel processes with different
exchange masses define branch cuts that are maximally
overlapping. This is exploited in (7).
The right-hand sides of (6) may require a slight modi-
fication if the contour function cðtÞ
 ðm2Þ hits a
threshold point s ¼ ðma  MaÞ2 or ðmb  MbÞ2 at a
critical value mcrit. Such a need reflects the possible
presence of an anomalous threshold [21,44,45]. In this
case the contour has to be deformed close to mcrit. For
instance, one may use a semicircle of radius ϵ centered
around mcrit.

While the form of the spectral weight is quite simple and intuitive, its associated phase factor is complicated, reflecting the
choices of various Riemann sheets. We follow here a pragmatic approach. We will not give complicated arguments about
which Riemann sheets to choose; rather, we present the final answer and assure that (6) was verified by numerical
simulations for sufficiently large energies. It is worth pointing out that (13) holds for arbitrarily small exchange masses for

In (15) we assume mu to be sufficiently large. Note the
formal similarity of the expressions for the contour func-
tions cðuÞ

mb ↔ Mb transforms the expressions into each other.
We turn to the general case with arbitrary exchange
masses. It suffices to provide explicit expressions for the
t-channel case. Corresponding expressions valid for the
u-channel term follow by the replacement mb ↔ Mb.

In a first step, we identify the points where a change of
Riemann sheets, and therewith a phase change, may be
required. All together there are 15 critical values for the
squared exchange mass m2
t . The expression (13) is valid for
m2

latter are associated with a change of Riemann sheets and,

where we apply the convenient notations (19), (22), and
(25). The result (27) deserves some discussion. The first
term in each of the four expressions in (27) describes the
opening of a normal left-hand cut at m2 > m2
t . While the
conditions m2 > v− characterize the opening of decay
channels of the exchanged particle the conditions m2 <
vþ signal an unstable initial or final state. Anomalous
thresholds open at m2 < tþ
. With (27) we also
specify implicitly which contour
runs through which
threshold points. This follows since each threshold point
is associated with a sign change of the spectral functions as
detailed in (27) at m2 ¼ tþ
. For a given plus or
minus contour and a selected case i ¼ 1; …; 4 in (26), two
critical values out of the four tþ
 points are selected
unambiguously.

 or m2 ¼ t−
 and t−

 or m2 < t−

The merit of (27) lies in its generality. It is a convenient
for coupled-channel studies with many
starting point
channels involved, where a case-by-case study is prohibi-
tive. In certain cases the result (27) may be further
simplified by the observation that there may be partial

cancellations of the plus and minus contour contributions in
regions where they are moving on the real axis. With (27) it
is straightforward to implement such cancellations in a
computer code.

We alert

crit ¼ tþ

the reader that

the result (27) requires an
analytic continuation for the case that a channel with
nonzero angular momentum L ≠ 0 is considered. This
implies that the functions λnðs; xÞ in (6) are singular at
thresholds and consequently the contour function cðtÞ
 ðm2Þ
needs to be deformed into the complex m2 plane close to
 and t−
the critical values m2
. Using semicircles
centered around the critical points
readily
is continued onto the
achieved. The spectral weight
deformed contour by the condition that it is continuous
along the semicircles. This leads to an unambiguous
definition of the Θ functions in (27) along the deformed
contour: Θ functions in the phase parameters of the
semicircles arise. Since the analytic expression for the
critical phases are quite complicated and implicit they
may be determined numerically.

representation (6) holds for sufficiently large s. It does not
necessarily hold for arbitrarily small energies. For the

The analytic continuation of the rhs of (6) is introduced
upon the identification of an appropriate closed contour,
inside which the spectral weight is analytic. For an energy
outside that closed domain the dispersion integral of (6),
is un-
considered with respect
changed. For s inside the closed domain it
is altered
necessarily. The closed contour needed for the desired
analytic continuation is readily identified with

where a closed domain arises upon the union of the plus

the expressions (29) vanish for exchange
masses m > mt on the closed contour as introduced in
(33). If the contour cuts through the largest threshold
point and the spectral weight would be nonvanishing in
this region a singular threshold behavior would arise
necessarily from the rhs of (6). This would contradict
the lhs of (6), which implies a regular behavior at the
largest threshold point always. The situation is recon-
ciled by the analytic continuation we are after. We find

Two cases need to be discriminated. Either both pseudo-

(38) is realized. The function tabðsÞ is defined implicitly
ﬃﬃﬃ
in (40). For s real the function tabðsÞ is real as well. The
sp > ma þ Ma
analytic continuation (40) is valid for
least. For smaller energies the
and
expressions may demand further modifications. The
continuation is necessary since the function tabðsÞ
may pass through zero while ImðpaðsÞpbðsÞÞ ≠ 0. This
is the condition (38). If one dropped the second term in
(40) the integral would be discontinuous right where
tabðsÞ ¼ 0. Such a discontinuity would be incompatible
with the representation (6). Note that for the validity of
(40) it
is irrelevant which of the various normal or
anomalous thresholds in (27) cause the occurrence of a
zero in tabðsÞ: in any case the proper result must be
that zero. A direct consequence of the
continuous at

analytic continuation is the presence of an anomalous
threshold behavior: due to the second line of (40) the
dispersion integral (6) may exhibit a singularity at a
threshold or pseudothreshold energy [44,45].

In a first step we compute the list of critical exchange
them in Table I for the t-channel
masses and collect
processes. For later convenience the critical points are
labeled from 1 to 15. Isospin averaged particle masses from
the Particle Data Group are used. All dimension full
quantities are expressed in units of the isospin averaged
pion masses. A critical exchange mass is not always active
in the expression (27). Only if it is larger than the mass of
the exchange particle it may turn relevant. The extra terms
introduced in (41) imply a further analytic continuation of
the dispersion integral (6). While the additional terms (34)
are required for the validity of (6) slightly above the largest
threshold point,
the extra contributions (44), (50) are
necessary to realize (6) in between the two nominal
thresholds. In the absence of such terms (6) holds only
for large s exceeding some critical value. All extra terms
(34), (44), and (50) will be illustrated by our t-channel
examples.

We briefly discuss the t-channel processes charac-
terized by the list of critical exchange points Table I.
For our first t-channel reaction πK → πK two critical
points vþ

relevant for both contour lines cðtÞ

For our first t-channel example both signatures are set to
−1 and remain unchanged throughout the contours.
For our second t-channel process πK → ρK, there are
six relevant critical points in the contour paths. The latter
are indicated in Fig. 3 by their label number 1, 2, 7, 8, 9,
10. The positions of the circled numbers in the plot
correspond to their numerical values as given in Table I.
All such points are larger than the square of the exchange
mass, in this case the pion mass, and therefore a proper
evaluation of the spectral weight depends on those 6
critical points. The contour paths are off the real axis
within the two intervals v−− < m2 < vþ− and v−
þ < m2 <
vþ
þ only. In general, any of the critical points 7, 8, 9, 10
signals that the contour leaves or returns to the real axis.
The corresponding critical contour points are surrounded
by open circles in our plots. The anomalous point 2

characterizes the exchange mass m2 ¼ tþ− at which the −
contour hits a threshold or pseudothreshold pillar.

corresponding spectral weights are given by case 1 in (27)
and (41). In contrast, however,
the spectral signatures
change several times now. In our plots the corresponding
critical points are indicated by their label number as
introduced in Table I. In particular, the extra terms (50)
prove relevant here. This is so since tþ− > m2

the associated closed contour. According to (43) the − part
is specified by ¯v−
þ. The þ part receives two

[see (48)]. As a consequence of tþ− > tþ
þ the additional
critical points t0 and ¯vþ are activated in (50). Indeed at
þ the − and þ spectral signatures are
m2 ¼ ¯v−
discontinuous, respectively. While in Fig. 3 the full lines
show the full spectral signatures in the presence of the extra
terms, the dotted lines show the results implied by (27)
only. We do not show possible contributions for m2 < 0 in
the plots for the clarity of the presentation. Due to the
condition m2 < ¯vþ
þ discussed above they are present
nevertheless in the þ spectral signature.

þ and m2 ¼ ¯vþ

We turn to the remaining three t-channel processes that
are illustrated in Fig. 4. The corresponding spectral
signatures are shown left and right of the contour lines
in the center of the plots. In all cases there are nontrivial
changes of the signatures at the various critical points. The
t-channel process πω → ρρ is characterized by the critical
contour points 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 and the condition t−
I > 0. With
vþ− < v−
þ < vþ
þ case 2 in (27) is implied. The conditions
þ and m2 ¼ t−− identify at which point the þ and −
m2 ¼ tþ
contours hit a threshold pillar, respectively. Moreover, the
extra terms (44) are active since it holds t−− > m2
π. The
corresponding closed contour is identified in (43) and (46)
which leads to ¯v−
þ parts, respectively.

With the t-channel process ρJ=Ψ → πρ we have an
example for case 3 in (27). The 6 critical contour points 1,

again the critical points are labeled through from 1 to 15.
All dimension full quantities are expressed in units of the
isospin averaged pion masses. We recall that a critical
exchange mass is not necessarily active in the expression
(27). Only if it is larger than the mass of the exchange
particle it may turn relevant. The additional terms in the
spectral density (41) as constructed in (34), (44), and (50)
will be needed for our example cases. Our results are
illustrated with Figs. 6 and 7 where besides the contour
paths in the center of the plots, the signatures of the spectral

are shown. There are integer numbers depending on m2 and

u. Like for our t-channel exchange studies the plots of the
spectral signatures include solid lines that show the full
signature with respect
to (41) and dotted lines that
correspond to the partial expressions (27). Possible con-
tributions at m2 < 0 are not shown for the clarity of the
presentation. In all plots the relevance of a critical point is
indicated by its label number as introduced in Table II.

consequence both contour lines pass through the threshold
and pseudothreshold of this reaction, i.e. ðmK  mKÞ2.
This occurs at the critical points m2 ¼ uþ
π and
m2 ¼ uþ− ¼ u−− > m2
π. Since in this reaction a π meson is
exchanged the relevant parts of the contours do reach both
threshold points. After all it holds u−
π. Therefore it
appears that the extra terms (34), properly transformed
from the t-channel kinematics to the u-channel kinematics
with t ↔ u, are active in this case. The associated
closed contour is characterized by ¯v−− < m2 < vþ− and
v−− < m2 < ¯vþ−. However, since ¯v−− ¼ vþ− and v−− ¼ ¯vþ−
these are empty conditions for the given example and
none of the terms in (34) are relevant. On the other hand we
may find a contribution of (44) since u−− > m2

Inspecting the contour paths in Fig. 6 one may be led to
the conclusion that the corresponding partial-wave pro-
jected amplitude has a branch cut going through the two
threshold points. However, this is not so. The effect of the

þ and − contours in (6) cancel in part, so that the full

contribution does not have such a branch cut. Nevertheless,
a branch cut emerges on the real axis, however, only at

energies where the þ and − contours do not overlap.

This follows since the þ and − spectral signatures have
opposite sign. As a consequence there is a branch
cut connecting the two particular points cðuÞ
πÞ >
ðmK þ mKÞ2 and cðuÞ− ðm2
πÞ > ðmK þ mKÞ2. Here we have
an example where a left-hand branch cut is located right to
the largest threshold pillar.
We discuss the πK → πK process of Fig. 6. This is a
further example with u−
þ > 0 where case 2 in (27) is
scrutinized. Again both contour lines pass through the
threshold and pseudothreshold of
i.e.
ðmπ  mKÞ2. This occurs at the critical points m2 ¼ uþ
þ ¼
u−
þ and m2 ¼ uþ− ¼ u−−. Since in this reaction a K meson
is exchanged, with a mass distribution starting at
ðmπ þ mKÞ2 > u−− > u−
þ, the relevant parts of the contours
do not reach any of the threshold points, however. Like in
our first example, even though we have u−− > m2
π and
u−
þ > 0, there are no contributions from (34) and (44).
This is so independent on the value of the exchange mass
mu. In Fig. 6 the contour lines are shown for m > mπ, in
order to illustrate the generic mechanism.

There are the remaining u-channel exchange processes
analyzed in Fig. 7. The first two reactions πρ → ¯KK and
πK → Kρ probe the case 2 in (27) with vþ− < v−
þ. The
extra terms in (34) prove relevant for the second reaction
with u−
π only. The corresponding closed contour
path is generated by the condition ¯v−− < m2 < vþ− and
v−− < m2 < ¯vþ− for the minus and plus contours, respec-
tively, [see (33)]. In contrast, the additional terms (44) are
needed in both cases. For the reaction πρ → ¯KK it holds
u−− > m2
K and the closed contour is given by ¯v−
þ < m2 <
þ and v−
vþ
þ < m2 < ¯vþ
þ. A slightly different condition is
derived for the πK → Kρ reaction with u−− > m2
π. Here
the closed contour follows from ¯v−
þ <
m2 instead.
We discuss the final u-channel reaction πJ=ψ → ππ. It is
described by the case 4 in (27) with vþ− > v−
þ. Since it holds
u−
þ < 0 here the extra terms (34) are not active. On the other
hand with uþ
ρ the terms (44) are needed. The
corresponding closed contour follows with ¯vþ− < m2 <
vþ
þ and vþ− < m2.

A concluding remark on the numerical implementation

of (6) is in order here. A partial cancellation of the þ and −

contour contributions in (6) occurs frequently. Whenever
the two contours run along identical regions on the real axis

this may happen. In a numerical implementation of (6) it is
useful to work out such cancellations explicitly. Based on
our general results, this is straightforwardly achieved in a
computer code.

V. SUMMARY

We have analyzed the generic structure of partial-wave
projected t- and u-channel exchange diagrams. A general
and explicit form for a dispersion-integral representation for
their contributions to partial-wave reaction amplitudes was
established. Our results hold for the case of overlapping left-
and right-hand cut structures, decaying particles and anoma-
lous thresholds or pseudothresholds. Various applications to
specific examples were worked out and illustrated in detail.
With our study, more realistic treatments of final state
interactions in the resonance region of QCD may become

feasible. The merit of the result lies in its generality. It is
a convenient basis for coupled-channel theories with a
large number of channels involved, where a case-by-case
study is prohibitive.
