To explain the observed neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism, a supersymmetric general-
ization of the standard model should include heavy right-handed neutrino supermultiplets. Then the
neutrino Yukawa couplings can induce CP violation in the lepton sector. In this paper, we compute the
contribution of these CP violating terms to lepton electric dipole moments. We introduce a new
formalism that makes use of supersymmetry to expose the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani cancellations.
In the region of small tan, we Ô¨Ånd a different result from that given previously by Ellis, Hisano,
Raidal, and Shimizu. We conÔ¨Årm the structure found by this group, but with a much smaller overall
coefÔ¨Åcient. In the region of large tan, we recompute the leading term that has been identiÔ¨Åed by
Masina and conÔ¨Årm her result up to minor factors. We discuss the implications of these results for
constraints on the Y.

I. INTRODUCTION

The discovery of neutrino mass has not only required
revision of the standard model of particle physics but also
of theories that go beyond the standard model. A com-
pelling idea for the origin of the observed small neutrino
masses is the seesaw mechanism. This requires the intro-
duction of heavy singlet leptons, that is, right-handed
neutrinos. In the context of supersymmetric theories,
these singlet leptons belong to new chiral supermultiplets
Ni, one for each fermion generation. The Yukawa cou-
plings and soft supersymmetry breaking terms associated
with these right-handed neutrino supermultiplets can
play important roles in lepton Ô¨Çavor-violating processes
[1] and in the production of the baryon number of the
universe through leptogenesis [2].

A particularly important aspect of this model is the
appearance of new sources of CP violation. In addition to
new CP violating parameters generic to new physics‚Äîin
supersymmetry, for example, the phases of  and the A ‚Äî
new phases are possible in the neutrino Yukawa couplings
and in the neutrino B term (BM ~N ~N). Complex Yukawa
couplings can lead to observable CP violation in neutrino
oscillations, and all of these parameters can be the source
of the CP violation that generated a fermion-antifermion
asymmetry in the early universe [2,3].

To test whether the observed matter-antimatter asym-
metry indeed arose from leptogenesis, it is necessary to
determine the CP violating phases from microscopic
measurements. There has been much analysis of CP vio-
lating observables in neutrino mixing. In principle, it is
possible to determine all seesaw parameters studying
neutrino and sneutrino mass matrices but, in practice, it
will be quite challenging, if possible at all, to extract all
of these parameters in the near future [4]. Another pos-
sible experimental approach to test CP violation in the
lepton sector is to measure the electric dipole moments

(EDMs) of charged leptons [5]. There are in fact many
possible ways that underlying CP violating couplings
could give rise to lepton EDMs. Thus, it is important to
classify these effects and, if possible, to learn how to
separate them from one another.

If CP violation is provided by phases of soft supersym-
metry breaking parameters, it is straightforward to gen-
erate a contribution to lepton electric dipole moments in
one-loop order. This possibility has been explored by
many authors [6]. However, it is also possible to generate
lepton EDMs in models in which the soft supersymmetry
breaking terms are CP conserving, by making use of
phases in the neutrino Yukawa couplings. A particularly
simple context to study this effect is to consider models in
which the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar masses are
exactly Ô¨Çavor universal and the A terms are exactly pro-
portional to the Yukawa couplings. Such models arise in
the simplest paradigms for gravity-mediated supersym-
metry breaking [7]. The idea of ‚Äò‚Äògaugino mediation‚Äô‚Äô
provides an attractive way to realize this scheme in the
context of a complete uniÔ¨Åed or superstring model [8].

In this class of models with universal soft supersym-
metry breaking interactions, the Ô¨Çavor and CP violation
due to the neutrino Yukawa couplings is computed by
integrating out the right-handed neutrino Ni superÔ¨Åelds.
This particular model has been studied in a number of
papers, beginning with [9]. In particular, the contribution
of neutrino Yukawa couplings to lepton EDMs has been
studied in this context by Romanino and Strumia [10],
Ellis, Hisano, Raidal, and Shimizu (EHRS) [11] and by
Masina [12]. These authors found that the analysis is
complicated by Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) can-
cellations, so that the Ô¨Årst nonzero contribution to the
EDMs arises in two-loop order and has the form of a
commutator of different combinations of the Yukawa
matrices.

The work of [11,12] used a renormalization-group
equation (RGE) approach to evaluate the leading loga-
rithmic contributions to the lepton EDMs. We thought
that it might be valuable to extend these calculations by
evaluating the complete contribution to the lepton EDMs
without making leading-log approximations. In this pa-
per, we present a new accounting method for the CP
violating effects of the right-handed neutrino sector
that makes this calculation straightforward. Our results,
however, differ from those of [11] even at the leading-log
level. We conÔ¨Årm the general structure of the answers
found by this group ‚Äîin particular,
the commutator
structure noted in the previous paragraph. However, we
claim that there are further cancellations not found in
their papers that one must resolve to obtain the correct
detailed formulas. We conÔ¨Årm Masina‚Äôs result for the
large tan region, up to some minor factors, using a
method that is much more transparent.

The outline of this paper is then as follows: In Sec. II,
we specify the model in which we are working. In Sec. 3,
we describe our procedure for integrating out the Ni
supermultiplets and identifying CP violating contribu-
tions. In Sec. IV, we carry out this procedure for the
leading CP violating contribution proportional to Y4
,
where Y is the neutrino Yukawa coupling. We Ô¨Ånd a result
that is parametrically smaller than that of EHRS by one
power of a large logarithm. In Sec. V, we reconsider the
analysis of EHRS and show how that logarithm cancels
out using their method. In Sec. VI, we give a formula for
the lepton EDMs that arises from this contribution.

In [12], Masina pointed out that, for large values of
tan, a different contribution can dominate the evaluation
of the lepton EDMs. This new term arises at one higher
loop order, at order Y4
‚Äò, where Y‚Äò is the charged lepton
Yukawa coupling. In Sec. VII, we evaluate this contribu-
tion, which requires a nontrivial
two-loop diagram
calculation.

Y2

In Sec. VIII, we make numerical estimates of the
electron EDM from our new formulas and compare these
to the results of other models of lepton CP violation.

Our calculations in this paper look speciÔ¨Åcally at the
terms resulting from integrating out the right-handed
neutrino sector. We work from an initial assumption that
the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are universal and
Ô¨Çavor independent. In a model with renormalizable inter-
actions that violate the Ô¨Çavor and CP symmetries, this
initial condition is not technically natural. Thus, there
will in general be other CP violating contributions, for
example, from the thresholds at the grand uniÔ¨Åcation
scale MGUT, that should be added to the formulas we
present here. Because, in all of our formulas, the leading
logarithmic behavior cancels due to a GIM cancellation,
our terms are not parametrically enhanced over those
from the GUT threshold. In speciÔ¨Åc models, the GUT-
scale terms can be numerically smaller than the terms

from the right-handed neutrino scale; the authors of [9],
for example, argue this for their SU(5) GUT model. In
any event, our formulas are computed precisely for the
effective theory of Sec. II with minimal subtraction (in
the DR scheme) at MGUT. By noting this prescription, it
should be straightforward to add GUT threshold correc-
tions to our results when these are computed in a particu-
lar GUT model.

II. THE MODEL

We consider

the supersymmetric standard model
coupled to three chiral supermultiplets Ni which contain
the heavy right-handed neutrinos associated with the
seesaw mechanism. The superpotential of the model con-
tains the following terms involving lepton supermultip-
lets:

W ¬à Yik

 H2NiLj

‚Äò H1EiLj √ø Yij

In this equation, Lj is the supermultiplet containing the
jL¬Ü, Ei is the superÔ¨Åeld
left-handed lepton Ô¨Åelds ¬ÖjL; ‚Äò√ø
whose left-handed fermion is ‚Äò¬á
iL, and Ni is the superÔ¨Åeld
whose left-handed fermion is iL. The Ni are singlets of
SU¬Ö2¬Ü  U¬Ö1¬Ü. We introduce the right-handed neutrino
masses Mij by hand, and we do not assume any a priori
relation of these parameters to the other couplings in (1).
Without loss of generality, we can choose the basis and
phases of L, E, and N such that Mij and Yij
‚Äò are real and
diagonal. We will refer to the diagonal elements of these
matrices as Mi, Y‚Äòi. These choices exhaust the freedom to
redeÔ¨Åne Ô¨Åelds, and so the matrix Yij
 is in general off
diagonal and complex. The mass matrix of light neutrinos
is given by

If the neutrino Yukawa couplings Yik
 are of order 1, the
requirement of small neutrino masses (m  0:1 eV)
leads to large values of the Mk, of the order of 1014 GeV.
To the Lagrangian generated by (1), we must add
appropriate soft supersymmetry breaking interactions.
In this paper, we will assume that slepton masses are
universal at the messenger scale (of the order of MGUT)
and that A terms are strictly proportional to the corre-
sponding Yukawa couplings, with a real constant of pro-
portionality. We will assume that the phases of  and of
the gaugino masses are zero. If these conditions are not
met, it is possible to generate EDMs from one-loop dia-
grams, a possibility that has been exhaustively explored
in the literature [6].

This restriction to universal, CP invariant, Ô¨Çavor in-
variant soft supersymmetry breaking terms is not a natu-
ral restriction of the model in the technical sense. It is

violated by loop corrections due to the neutrino Yukawa
couplings. In fact, our analysis in this paper is to calculate
the CP violation induced by these corrections. Con-
sequently, the effects we Ô¨Ånd can be cut-off dependent.
As we have explained in the Introduction, we will impose
the universality and Ô¨Çavor symmetry of the soft super-
symmetry breaking interactions as an initial condition,
deÔ¨Åned by minimal subtraction in the DR scheme at
MGUT.

With this prescription, we will take the soft supersym-

metry breaking terms for the lepton sector to be

where ~f collectively represents sfermions, and we assume
that a0, bH and B are real parameters. The parameters
m0, ma, a0, and bH all have the dimensions of mass and
are of order MSUSY  100 GeV √ø 1 TeV. CP violating
phases arise both from the neutrino Yukawa couplings
and from the neutrino A term, but, in this model, they
are controlled by the same parameters. We should note
that if any of the parameters a0, bH or B has an imagi-
nary part, the corresponding term can give a large con-
tribution to lepton EDMs. This point is discussed in some
detail elsewhere [6]. The speciÔ¨Åc effects of the B term
have been analyzed in [13].

In computing the effects of the Ni supermultiplets, it is
convenient to work in components, keeping the auxiliary
Ô¨Åelds (the F Ô¨Åelds) as independent Ô¨Åelds. We use two-
component notation for the fermion Ô¨Åelds. With the ef-
fects of the Majorana mass term included, the propagators
for the component Ô¨Åelds of the Ni take the form

III. RADIATIVE CORRECTIONS DUE TO Y
As it is well known, radiative corrections will distort
the form of Eq. (3) and break the exact mass degeneracy
between the sfermions. In this section, we will focus on
those radiative corrections to the parameters of Eq. (3)
that can induce CP-violating phase and EDMs, in par-
ticular, the effects of diagrams involving the neutrino
Yukawa and A terms. We will discuss the form of the
effective Lagrangian at scales just below the right-handed
neutrino mass scale. When we compute the induced
EDMs in Secs. VI and VII, we will need to take into
account some additional effects that come from renor-
malization group running down to the electroweak scale.
In our analysis, we will always assume that the right-
handed neutrino masses Mk are much larger than the
supersymmetry breaking mass terms, of order MSUSY,
so that any contribution suppressed by MSUSY=Mk
can be neglected. In this limit, the calculation that inte-
grates out the right-handed neutrino sector divides neatly
into a part that corrects the supersymmetric Lagrangian
and a part that corrects the supersymmetry breaking
perturbations.

First, we consider the radiative corrections to the
supersymmetric part of the Lagrangian. We begin by
noting that, to a good approximation, we can neglect
diagrams that include vertices from the supersymmetry
breaking terms. Except for the  term, all coefÔ¨Åcients in
the supersymmetric Lagrangian are dimensionless, while
all supersymmetry breaking terms have coefÔ¨Åcients with
mass parameters of order 1 TeV or smaller. Therefore,
corrections to the dimensionless coefÔ¨Åcients from the
supersymmetry breaking terms are at most of the order
of MSUSY=Mk, completely negligible. Corrections to the 
term are at most of the order of b0a0=M2
k, again, a
negligible correction.

The radiative corrections within the supersymmetric
theory are strongly restricted by the constraints of super-
symmetry. All component Ô¨Åelds within supermultiplet
receive the same radiative corrections. By the nonre-
normalization theorem [14], the superpotential receives
no corrections. The result of this theorem constrains only
the leading term in a Taylor series in external momenta,
but, since these diagrams are evaluated at external mo-
menta of order MSUSY, terms that depend on external
momenta are suppressed by powers of MSUSY=Mk and
can be ignored. Then the most general effective
Lagrangian obtained by integrating out the Nk multiplets
will have the form

tion theory. Note that while ¬ÖZL¬Üij receives off-diagonal
corrections at the one-loop level, ¬ÖZE¬Üij receives off-
diagonal elements only at the two-loop level because E
does not have any Ô¨Çavor number violating coupling.

To generate a lepton electric dipole moment, we require
a Ô¨Çavor-diagonal matrix element of an electromagnetic
form factor to have an imaginary part [15]. However,
the radiative corrections
from the supersymmetric
Lagrangian, treated to Ô¨Årst order, will be proportional
to the matrices ZL and ZE. Since the diagonal elements
of a Hermitian matrix are real, none of these corrections,
acting alone, can induce a lepton electric dipole moment.
This is an important constraint, which we will continue
to follow through our analysis.

The soft

supersymmetry breaking part of

the
Lagrangian receives corrections proportional to the su-
persymmetry breaking parameters. However, the form is
still quite constrained. The most general effective

Contributions to the lepton EDMs come from diagrams
of the general form of Fig. 1, in which a right-handed
lepton is converted to a left-handed lepton through a
photon vertex diagram. A lepton line runs through the
diagram, and the matrices (12) appear as insertions on
this line. By the arguments just given, we need to consider
contributions with two separate insertions. The product
(14) comes uniquely from diagrams of the form of
Fig. 2(a), with the photon inserted in all possible posi-
tions on the lepton line. The product (15) comes from
diagrams of the form of Fig. 2(b). In the latter diagram,

evaluate these diagrams in Secs. VI and VII, respectively.

corrections, which depend in a model-dependent way on
GUT-scale physics, can be of the same order of magnitude
as (23).

V. COMPARISON TO THE RGE APPROACH

It is remarkable that, to order Y4

, the only contribution
to the lepton EDM comes from the invariant Ci and that
there is no contribution from Im¬âA‚Äò¬ä. This conÔ¨Çicts with
previous results on lepton EDMs given by EHRS [11]
and Masina [12]. In this section, we will compute the

leading logarithmic contributions to Im¬âA‚Äò¬ä using the
renormalization-group method and demonstrate explic-
itly that they cancel. At the end of the section, we will
compare our analysis to that of [11,12].

However, direct calculation of the diagrams in Fig. 6 with
Euclidean external momenta with jQ2j  M2

To carry out the renormalization-group analysis, we
must integrate the RGEs from an initial condition at
MGUT to the heaviest N mass, M3, then from M3 to M2,
then from M2 to M1. This procedure is valid only if M1 
M2  M3. Let us deÔ¨Åne

For a hierarchical spectrum of masses, we expect this
procedure to reproduce the results of two-loop calcula-
tions up to the order Y4

It is very important to write the RGEs in such a way
that the right-handed neutrino thresholds are accounted
correctly. There are two aspects to this. First, one should,
at each stage of integration, project out those Ni‚Äôs that
have masses above the scale at which the RGE is being
evaluated. To discuss this, it is useful to introduce projec-
tors P3 ¬à 1, P2 ¬à diag¬Ö1; 1; 0¬Ü, P1 ¬à diag¬Ö1; 0; 0¬Ü, pro-
jecting onto the N mass eigenstates that are still active
as we integrate through the various thresholds. Second,
one should be careful to keep the matrices Y‚Äò and M
diagonal, at least when heavy particles are integrated out.
We found it surprising that it is necessary to worry
about off-diagonal terms in M, and so we would like to
illustrate this with an example. In the appendix of [12],
the RGE for the neutrino Yukawa coupling is given as

¬à 3YYy

 PaY ¬á  :

dY

(27)

The contribution on the right-hand side arises from the
diagrams shown in Fig. 6. The projector eliminates con-
tributions from the right-handed neutrinos with mass
Mk > Q. Consider, in particular, integrating this equation
down to a Q such that M2 < Q < M3. Let tQ ¬à t¬ÖM3¬Ü √ø
t¬ÖQ¬Ü. Then the integration gives

(29)

since in the Ô¨Årst diagram the contribution from N3 in the
internal line labeled Nm has a propagator proportional to
1=¬ÖQ2 ¬á M2¬Ü and so is suppressed for Q2  M2
3.

The direct calculation is correct. The problem is that, at
this level, the application of the renormalization-group
method is incomplete. The neutrino mass matrix also
acquires off-diagonal terms from the RGE. For Q  M3

Thus, we should, Ô¨Årst, integrate all of the RGEs down to a
scale of the order of M3; second, diagonalize the mass
matrix M at this scale and rewrite the couplings in this
new basis; third, integrate out its largest eigenvalue; and,
Ô¨Ånally, use the rotated couplings as the initial conditions
for the stage of integration from M3 to M2.

It is not difÔ¨Åcult to see that this prescription precisely
eliminates the term that does not appear in (29) from (28).
The Ô¨Årst diagram in Fig. 6 modiÔ¨Åes the neutrino Yukawa
coupling by a Ô¨Åeld strength renormalization factor Y !
Z√ø1=2
Y. Equation (30) induces a similar modiÔ¨Åcation in
the mass matrix, M ! Z√ø1=2
¬ÜT. The ZN factors
are the same in the two expressions due to the nonre-
normalization theorem. When we now diagonalize M at
the scale M3, the change of basis cancels the off-diagonal
1‚Äì3 and 2‚Äì3 elements of Z√ø1=2

N M¬ÖZ√ø1=2

that affect Y.

To control this effect, one must integrate through all
three thresholds by carefully solving the RGE for all
couplings and mass terms. However, here we only wish
to develop expressions for the effective couplings to order
t2, in order to check the results of the previous sections.
For this, it is easier and more direct to use the following
procedure: First, we integrate the renormalization-group
equations for the couplings. Then we identify terms that
correspond to diagrams such as the Ô¨Årst one in Fig. 6 with
decoupling internal lines, and we remove these contribu-
tions by hand.

We should be careful also to remove diagrams with
intermediate FN lines, since FN also decouples, as we see
from the last line of (4). One-loop diagrams involving the
supersymmetry breaking a0 term can produce mixing of
L and FL or N and FN, for example, as in the diagram
shown in Fig. 4. In the RGE evolution of A, we encounter

In
this contribution, the off-diagonal terms decouple and
should be removed at the same time that we remove
intermediate N3 lines. Unless this is done, one cannot
see the complete cancellation of Im¬âA‚Äòii¬ä that we will
present below. In an RGE analysis, this step requires
treating FN as a separate Ô¨Åeld in the Lagrangian and

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 70 095001
diagonalizing the NFN quadratic terms generated
through RGE evolution.

With this insight into how to treat self-energy terms in
the RGEs, we can integrate the RGEs for coupling con-
stants through the three thresholds. The renormalization-
group equations for coupling constants are as given the

The observation that lepton EDMs are proportional to
the commutator of Y0 and Y1 is the most important result
of the analysis of EHRS [11]. Once this result has been
found, it is straightforward to obtain the correct order of
magnitude for the contribution to lepton EDMs from the
phases of neutrino Yukawa couplings. Thus, the qualita-
tive dependence of EDMs on the underlying supersym-
metry parameters is given correctly in this paper, even
though the actual terms that produce the lepton EDMs are
different.

such as Y  tr¬âYYy
¬ä that do not contribute to EDMs.
Using the prescription that we have explained above, we
Ô¨Ånd different results from those found previously. When
we solve for A‚Äò and for Y‚Äò at a scale much smaller than
M1, we Ô¨Ånd that the imaginary parts of Y‚Äò and A‚Äò=a0 are
identical and are equal to

I m¬âY‚Äò¬ÖK3K2t3t2 ¬á K3K1t3t1 ¬á K2K1t2t1¬Ü¬ä:

Now one more step is needed. As in (10), we need to
choose a new basis for the leptons in which Y‚Äò is real
diagonal after taking into account the radiative correc-
tions due to the Ni. Since the imaginary parts of Y‚Äò and
A‚Äò=a0 found at
the previous stage are identical, this
completely removes the imaginary part of A‚Äò, in agree-
ment with our analysis in Sec. 3.
It is not clear to us how the analyses of [11,12] found
nonzero diagonal terms of Im¬âA‚Äò¬ä at this order. The dis-
cussion in [11] does not discuss the issue of rediagonaliz-
ing Y‚Äò and M. On the other hand, [12] writes the
renormalization-group equations in a way that explicitly
takes into account the decoupling of heavy states, as we
have noted above. In addition, the calculations done in
this paper keep Y‚Äò and M diagonal by adding terms to
these RGEs following the ‚Äò‚Äòrotating basis‚Äô‚Äô prescription of
Brax and Savoy [16]. The full RGEs considered are not
written explicitly in [12], but nevertheless they are used
to generate the results that are quoted there [17]. One
possible difÔ¨Åculty is that this analysis might not remove
the terms with decoupling hNFNi propagators that we
have discussed above (31).

The renormalization-group running of the soft super-
symmetry breaking masses from the GUT-scale to the
electroweak-scale corrections gives large but Ô¨Çavor-
independent corrections to the ~E and ~L masses propor-
tional to the GUT-scale gaugino masses. These terms do
not contribute to the Ô¨Çavor-violating effects that give the
dipole matrix element an imaginary part, but they should
be taken into account
in the denominator of (35) in
evaluating this imaginary part. Thus, we have written
(35) as depending on the electroweak-scale values of
these masses m ~E and m ~L. The full expression (35) can
be checked against many papers on lepton dipole mo-
ments, for example, [18‚Äì20].

Starting from (35), we replace A‚Äò by a0Y‚ÄòZA, and we

Masina [12] has argued that, for large tan, a different
contribution to the lepton EDM can be the dominant one.
Looking back at the diagrams of Figs. 1 and 2 studied in
the previous section, we see that it is advantageous at
large tan to drop A‚Äò and keep instead the term  tan.
We still need a second loop correction to combine with
m2

This formula is the exact result to order Y2

 with
regularization by minimal subtraction at
ultraviolet
MGUT. It does not assume that the right-handed neutrino
masses are hierarchial. The dependence on MSUSY, with
terms of at most one logarithm,
is consistent with
renormalization-group evolution from the heavy neutrino
scale to the weak scale. The leading logarithmic terms in
this expression are in precise agreement with the result of
Masina [12] after correction of a small algebraic error.
The dominant contribution to the EDMs for large tan
is now found by inserting both ¬Öm2
~L into the
vertex diagram as shown in Fig. 2(b). The imaginary part
of the diagram is proportional to the structure (15). The
contributions to this formula have up to three powers of
logarithms. Just as in the evaluation of Ci, we can take

for Ci the next subleading logarithm also cancels out,

The parameter MN is a mean right-handed neutrino
mass. The precise deÔ¨Ånition of this mass is unimportant,
because, as in (23), the various factors of MN cancel out of
(50) when we use the antisymmetry of the structure
Im¬âY4
¬ä. It is convenient to choose MN as the geometric
mean of the Mk to minimize the individual logarithms
in (50).

If

the right-handed neutrino masses are strongly
hierarchial, as was assumed by [12], (50) is enhanced
by three large logarithmic factors. The formula we

have given here is valid for any right-handed neutrino
spectrum; for a spectrum without
large hierarchies,
the leading term still has two large logarithms. We
also conÔ¨Årm the result of [12] that
the logarithmic
dependence on MSUSY cancels in the leading order
of logarithms, though a small dependence does remain
in a subleading term. The coefÔ¨Åcient of our leading
term is almost identical to that found by Masina, with
only small algebraic corrections in the terms in-
volving a0.

terms of the neutrino Yukawa couplings as those previ-
ously given in [11,12]. However, the form of the integrals
contributing to F25i is different because there is an extra
mass insertion. Further, the overall size of the effect is
decreased from the previous estimates, especially in the
region of low tan.

There is an important test for the origin of lepton
EDMs in the neutrino sector. While complex a0 and 
induce EDMs both for the charged leptons and for the
neutron, effects from the neutrino sector give zero EDM
for the neutron while making nonzero contributions for
the leptons. However, an EDM present only for leptons
could in principle arise from an imaginary part to the A‚Äò
coefÔ¨Åcient or the neutrino B term as well as from loop
effects involving Y. It is interesting to compare the
magnitudes of the effects from loop level or tree level
CP-violating contributions.

In the low tan region, the effect that we have com-
puted in (38) gives a lepton EDM of the order of magni-

where h¬ÖxL; xE¬Ü is given in Appendix C. In the above
formula, we have kept only the leading logarithmic
terms, that is, terms with two large logarithms in the
case of a general right-handed neutrino mass spectrum
and with three large logarithms in the case of a hierar-
chial mass spectrum. If we wish to give an expression
valid, in the general case, at the level of one large loga-
rithm, we should include the corrections to Di from the
TeV threshold, replacing the MSUSY by the actual masses
of ~L and H1. At the same time, we must include an
additional contribution, shown in Fig. 8,
involving a
two-loop integral with momenta at the TeV scale. An
analysis to this accuracy is beyond the scope of this paper.

VIII. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have reevaluated the contributions
from neutrino Yukawa couplings to the lepton EDMs. In
contrast to previous studies, we have shown that, in the
mass basis of charged leptons, up to two-loop level,
neutrino Yukawa couplings do not induce an imaginary
part to the diagonal elements of the A‚Äò term. However,
complex neutrino Yukawa couplings can create EDMs for
charged leptons through differences in the renormaliza-
tion of the A‚Äò terms and the slepton masses terms,
through the diagrams shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Our ex-
pressions for the lepton EDMs have the same structure in

PHYSICAL REVIEW D 70 095001

Over the longer term, CP-violating effects of complex
neutrino Yukawa couplings can also be probed by lepton
Ô¨Çavor oscillation in slepton production at colliders [27],
and perhaps also in sneutrino-antisneutrino oscillation
[28]. Better understanding of the systematics of lepto-
genesis can also play a role on constraining the neutrino
Yukawa couplings. All of this information will comple-
ment the knowledge that we are gaining from neutrino
oscillation experiments to help us build a complete picture
of the neutrino Ô¨Çavor interactions.

APPENDIX A: CORRECTIONS TO THE LEPTON

A TERM

In any given loop order, the contributions of the heavy
singlet lepton N will be a polynomial in the Yukawa
coupling coefÔ¨Åcients in (1). Since in the basis we are
using Y‚Äò is real and diagonal, nontrivial Ô¨Çavor effects
will come only from polynomials in Yij
 . In particular,
for the problem at hand, we are interested in polynomials
that contribute to the A‚Äò term and have a nonzero imagi-
nary part.
A given diagram with only one N line could, in prin-
ciple, contain structures Y  Y
. The
vertex A‚Äò conserves the number of H2 (in fact H2 has no
A‚Äò coupling). However, the vertices A and Y change the
number of H2 by one unit. Since we ignore the masses of L
and H2 in diagrams involving N, the L and H numbers
are conserved by internal propagators. Therefore, any
radiative correction to A‚Äò has equal numbers of Y and Y
.
Consider a diagram contributing to A‚Äò with only one N
line and ¬Ön ¬á m¬Ü Y‚Äò vertices. From the above result, we
see that the most general polynomial that can appear in
such diagrams is

Now let us focus on two-loop diagrams with more than
one N line. In such diagrams four A vertices are in-
volved. A contribution from a product of two one-loop
diagrams, as shown in Fig. 9, has the polynomial struc-
ture

under Mm $ Mn, the structures appearing in (A3) and

these functions have the required symmetry. But it is not
difÔ¨Åcult to show this by explicit examination of the dia-
grams. All the relevant diagrams are shown in Fig. 10.
Since the momenta propagating in the loops are of order
of MN, we can neglect the external momenta, which for
our purposes are of order of MSUSY. With this simpliÔ¨Åca-
tion, it can be seen that all these diagrams are symmetric
under Mm $ Mn. This completes the proof that, up to
two-loop level, the diagonal elements of A‚Äò remain real.

[15] The imaginary parts of the off-diagonal elements of m2
~L
give contributions to the electric transition moments of
Majorana neutrinos. These moments can play a role in the
cooling process of the core of red giants if their values is
higher than 10√ø23 e cm. See G. G. Raffelt, Phys. Rep.
