The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is

the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

fluxgate magnetometer, versus the EDM values. A slope is evident. The
majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ

unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is
from jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ to the state 1ﬃﬃ
p

the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ
p
unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

Improved measurement of the shape of the electron

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is
from jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ to the state 1ﬃﬃ
p
2
the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

is the fit to the cosine-squared model.

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ
p
unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

Improved measurement of the shape of the electron

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is
from jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ to the state 1ﬃﬃ
p
2
the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

fluxgate magnetometer, versus the EDM values. A slope is evident. The
majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ
p
unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is

the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ
p
unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

Improved measurement of the shape of the electron

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is
from jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ to the state 1ﬃﬃ
p

the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ
p
unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

Improved measurement of the shape of the electron

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is
from jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ to the state 1ﬃﬃ
p
2
the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

Figure 4 | The magnetic field correlated with the E reversal, measured at the
fluxgate magnetometer, versus the EDM values. A slope is evident. The
majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ
p
unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain

the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm

indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is

the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

fluxgate magnetometer, versus the EDM values. A slope is evident. The
majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ

unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

The electron is predicted to be slightly aspheric1, with a distortion
characterized by the electric dipole moment (EDM), de. No experi-
ment has ever detected this deviation. The standard model of
particle physics predicts that de is far too small to detect2, being
some eleven orders of magnitude smaller than the current experi-
mental sensitivity. However, many extensions to the standard
model naturally predict much larger values of de that should be
detectable3. This makes the search for the electron EDM a powerful
way to search for new physics and constrain the possible exten-
sions. In particular, the popular idea that new supersymmetric
particles may exist at masses of a few hundred GeV/c2 (where cis
the speed of light) is difficult to reconcile with the absence of an
electron EDM at the present limit of sensitivity2,4. The size of the
EDM is also intimately related to the question of why the Universe
has so little antimatter. If the reason is that some undiscovered
particle interaction5 breaks the symmetry between matter and anti-
matter, this should result in a measurable EDM in most models of
particle physics2. Here we use cold polar molecules to measure the
electron EDM at the highest level of precision reported so far,
providing a constraint on any possible new interactions. We obtain
de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228ecm, where eis the charge on
the electron, which sets a new upper limit ofjdej , 10.5 3 10228ecm
with 90 per cent confidence. This result, consistent with zero,
indicates that the electron is spherical at this improved level of
precision. Our measurement of atto-electronvolt energy shifts in
a molecule probes new physics at the tera-electronvolt energy
scale2.

Just as a magnetic dipole moment m in a magnetic field B has an
energy 2m ? B, an electric dipole moment d in an electric field E has an
energy 2d ? E in the non-relativistic limit. A permanent EDM of the
electron must lie along its spin6, s, that is, d 5 des, making the elec-
tron’s energy depend on whether the spin is parallel or antiparallel to E.
In an atom or molecule with an unpaired valence electron, the inter-
action of the electron EDM with an applied electric field results in an
energy difference between two states that differ only in their spin
orientation. This energy difference is proportional to de and changes
sign when the direction of the field is reversed. A sensitive method of
measuring this energy difference is to align the spin perpendicular to
the field and measure its precession rate, which is proportional to the
energy difference. An alternative description of the method is in terms
of an interferometer. There is quantum interference between the two
spin states, and the EDM appears as an interferometer phase shift that
changes sign when the electric field is reversed.

To improve on the previous limit7 we developed a technique using
the dipolar molecule YbF (ref. 8) instead of the spherical Tl atom. This
has two great advantages. First, at our modest operating field the
interaction energy9–15 of YbF due to de is 220 times larger than that
obtained using Tl in a much larger field7. Second, the motional mag-
netic field, a source of systematic error that plagued the Tl experiment,
has a negligible effect on YbF (ref. 8). Because of these advantages, it is
possible to improve on the Tl experiment by using YbF molecules, even
though the molecules are produced in much smaller numbers. A
number of other EDM measurements, based on electron spin preces-
sion in atoms, molecules, molecular ions or solids, are in progress4.

Figure 1 shows the interferometer apparatus16. Pulses of YbF mol-
ecules are emitted by the source17. The experiment uses those mole-
cules in the F 5 0 and F 5 1 hyperfine levels of the ground state. The
molecules pass through a first fluorescence detector, the pump
detector, which simultaneously measures and empties out the F 5 1
population. Then they enter a pair of electric field plates, between
Þ^z, where ^z is the
which are static electric and magnetic fields E, Bð
unit vector in the z direction (Fig. 1). This region is magnetically
shielded. A radio-frequency (r.f.) pulse is applied to transfer molecules
Þ, where mF is
from jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ to the state 1ﬃﬃ
p

the component of the total angular momentum, F, along the z-axis. The
molecules then evolve freely for a time T, during which the mF 5 61
components develop a phase difference of 2w 5 2(mBB 2 deEeff)T/B,
where mB is the Bohr magneton. This is due to the Zeeman shift
1mBBmF (ref. 18) and to the EDM shift expressed by the effective
interaction 2deEeffmF (see Methods). A second r.f. pulse is then
applied, resulting in a final F 5 0 population proportional to cos2w,
which the second fluorescence detector subsequently measures. For
every pulse of molecules, the time-resolved signals from the pump
and probe detectors are recorded; an example probe signal is shown
in Fig. 2.

Scanning the phase difference via the magnetic field generates an
interference curve, shown in Fig. 3. Reversal of the applied electric field
produces a small phase shift dw 5 2deEeffT/B, leading to a change in the
detector count of dI 5 (dI/dw)dw. This is maximized by operating the
interferometer at B 5 613.6 nT, which corresponds to w 5 6p/4, the
steepest points on either side of the central fringe (Fig. 3). The intensity
change is opposite on the two sides of the fringe because the slopes are
opposite. Thus the EDM signal dI is the part of the fluorescence count
that is correlated with the sign of E?B. We calibrate the slope dI/dw by
making a step dB 5 61.7 nT in magnetic-field magnitude, and this too
is done on each side of the central fringe. In addition to E, B and dB,
several other parameters are switched in the experiment. The laser
frequency is stepped by 6340 kHz, the frequencies of the two r.f. pulses
(nrf1 and nrf2) are independently stepped by 61.5 kHz, their amplitudes
(arf1 and arf2) are independently stepped by 65%, and the phase dif-
ference (Wrf) between them is stepped around a randomly chosen
value, w0, by 6p/2. A computer places the machine in a new switch
state before every beam pulse. The measurements are grouped into
‘blocks’ of 4,096 beam pulses, over which all 512 combinations of
switch states are covered equally. Error signals, derived from each

block of data, are fed back to the switched parameters to keep them
switching around their optima.

Our measurement is derived from 6,194 blocks of data taken in
2010, comprising 25 million molecular beam pulses, together with
many subsidiary measurements used to search for systematic errors.
To analyse the data, we select the central 130 ms of each probe pulse
(Fig. 2) and normalize it pulse by pulse to the pump fluorescence. This
minimizes the effect of fluctuations of the molecular beam intensity.
We calculate how much of the gated, normalized fluorescence signal is
correlated with all 512 possible combinations of the modulated para-
meters. These correlations are called ‘channels’ and are denoted by {X},
where X indicates the parameter (or parameter combination) being
modulated. The EDM phase shift, normalized to the shift from the
small magnetic field step dB, is {E?B}/{dB}. The other channels are
valuable in elucidating the operation of the apparatus. Throughout the
investigation the EDM values were concealed by adding a fixed
unknown offset, which was only removed once the data collection
and analysis were complete.

The EDM values obtained from the set of blocks are almost normally
distributed but there tend to be a few more points in the wings of the
distribution than in a normal distribution. The same is true of other
quantities of interest that we extract from the data. For all these quantities,
we calculate the 5% trimmed mean19, a simple robust statistic that drops
the largest and smallest 5% of the data. We use the bootstrap method20 to
determine the associated statistical uncertainty. For non-normal distri-
butions, these methods give more reliable measures than the mean and
standard error.

Fluctuations in the ambient magnetic field of the laboratory inevitably
have some component that is, by chance, synchronous with the switch-
ing pattern of E. This contributes a little to the noise in the EDM, as
shown in Fig. 4, though not to the long-time average value. We suppress

Magnetic field in E-channel (arbitrary units)

majority of measurements are not significantly perturbed by the magnetic field,
but a small fraction do benefit from correction.

this excess noise by correcting the EDM, block by block, according to
the magnetic field readings of a magnetometer (Methods). The central
value and statistical uncertainty of this magnetic field correction are
given in Table 1. The correction has a negligible effect on the central
value of the EDM but reduces the statistical error by 3.5%.

We find that the phase of the interferometer shifts linearly with the
detunings of the r.f. pulses at a rate of (283 6 6) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for
the first r.f. pulse, and (294 6 5) 3 1029 rad Hz21 for the second r.f.
pulse. If the magnitude of the electric field changes when E is reversed,
then through the Stark shift, the r.f. transition frequency changes. This
results in a change in the interferometer phase that correlates with E,
mimicking the EDM phase. This systematic error can be corrected
using the information contained in every block of data. The phase
change resulting from a detuning of the first r.f. pulse is measured
by {nrf1?B}, and the change in the detuning resulting from the change
in electric field magnitude is measured by {nrf1?E}. The product of
these two channels, together with a calibration factor that we have
measured, determines the EDM-like phase due to the E-correlated
detuning of the first r.f. transition, and we use this to apply a correction
to each block of data. A similar correction is made for the second r.f.
pulse. The central values and statistical uncertainties of the two r.f.
phase corrections are given in Table 1. As an additional check, we
made measurements in which we deliberately change the r.f. frequency
when we switch E. We see that the resulting systematic error is entirely
removed once the corrections are applied to these data, thus verifying
the correction procedure.

There are several sources of systematic uncertainty on the EDM
measurement that must be considered. First, there may be systematic
effects, other than the r.f.-induced phases described above, caused by a
change in field magnitude when E reverses. We investigate this by
changing the field magnitude intentionally by dE when the field
switches. Once the r.f. phase corrections are applied to these data,

The units are 10228e cm. The statistical uncertainty on the corrections gives a measure of their random
spread over the whole data set. In the final analysis the corrections are applied block-by-block, so these
statistical uncertainties are naturally incorporated in the final EDM statistical uncertainty. The
systematic uncertainty in the corrections is negligible.

we find no evidence of any residual systematic EDM that depends on
dE. The upper bound on the gradient of any such systematic, with
respect to dE, is 211 3 10228e cm/(V cm21). In the r.f. regions we
measure asymmetries dE of approximately 100 mV cm21 and we take
this to be typical throughout the interaction region. Combining this
level of asymmetry with the worst-case slope above gives a systematic
uncertainty of 1.1 3 10228e cm (Table 1).

Electric-field-plate potentials that are not symmetric around the
ground potential are another possible source of systematic error. We
characterize this in terms of the mean potential V of the two electric
field plates relative to the surrounding grounded apparatus. Near the
edges of the plates, the field does not point entirely along ^z, but the
direction of the field reverses perfectly as long as V 5 0. However,
when V=0 the reversal is imperfect, and this, coupled with other
imperfections, may result in a systematic error. We investigate this
by deliberately applying large mean potentials of V 5 21,000.5 V and
V 5 11,015.0 V, and we find from this data a systematic shift with a
slope of (0.099 6 0.016) 3 10228e cm V21. The plate potentials used
for our data set are measured to have a mean voltage of less than 1 V.
This results in a systematic uncertainty of 0.1 3 10228e cm.

A study of the data taken at non-zero V revealed an unexplained
correlation between the measured EDM and the frequency detuning of
the first r.f. pulse. Unlike the effect described above, this systematic
effect does not depend on dE. We see no evidence of the effect in the
data taken at V 5 0. Nonetheless, by considering the worst-case cor-
relation consistent with the V ~0 data, and the measured average
frequency detuning of the first r.f. pulse, we calculate a conservative
systematic uncertainty of 1 3 10228e cm.

The direction of the electric field in the rest frame of the molecules
rotates slightly as they move through the apparatus. This induces a geo-
metric interferometer phase that can result in a systematic error21. We
calculate an upper limit on this effect (see Supplementary Information) of
3 3 10230 e cm.

Magnetic fields generated inside the magnetic shields that reverse
with the electric field are a potential source of systematic error. These
magnetic fields are not well sensed by the magnetometers, which are
outside the inner layer of magnetic shielding. We consider the three
mechanisms that could generate such fields:
(1) Leakage current to the high-voltage plates. The current flowing to
or from each electric field plate is monitored22 throughout the experi-
ment. The component that reverses synchronously with E is less than
1 nA averaged over the EDM data set. A most conservative estimate
(see Supplementary Information) of the possible false EDM given by
these currents is 0.2 3 10228e cm.
(2) Inner-shield magnetization. It is possible that the plate-charging cur-
rents could magnetizetheshields, generating a magnetic field that reverses
with E. We have determined this field by pulsing a hundred times the
normal current through a similar shield set-up on the bench and mea-
suring the resulting field with a fluxgate magnetometer. We deduce that
thefalseEDMduetoshieldmagnetizationis(20.16 6 0.17) 3 10228e cm.
As this is consistent with zero, we do not make any correction to the
measured EDM, but allow a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 3 10228e cm.
(3) Motional magnetic field. The laboratory-frame electric field has a
magnetic component in the rest frame of the molecules Bm 5 E 3 v/c2,
where v is the velocity of the molecules with respect to the apparatus.
This can produce a false EDM if there is also a stray magnetic field By.
This was a limiting systematic error in ref. 7. The effect is strongly
suppressed in our case because of the large (8 MHz) tensor Stark
splitting of the F 5 1 manifold, which renders the molecule insensitive
to magnetic fields in the x–y plane, as discussed in ref. 8. Our stray By is
everywhere less than 30 nT, which gives a calculated false EDM of less
than 5 3 10232e cm. We have also checked empirically that the addi-
tion of a 500 nT transverse field produces no evident effect.

A number of other consistency checks and searches for systematic
errors were made and are described in detail in the Supplementary
Information.

Figure 5 | EDM values for each manual-reversal state of the machine. The
error bars indicate the 68% confidence level. The most important manual
reversal is the electric-field reversal: the first four points correspond to one
electric-field configuration, and the last four to the other. The solid and dashed
lines show the mean value and its statistical error.

In addition to the computer-controlled switches, we make three
manual reversals. The high-voltage connections are swapped to
reverse E, the magnet wires are interchanged to reverse B and the
r.f. cables are swapped to reverse the direction of r.f. propagation along
the field plates. These manual changes are made infrequently—
typically one switch per day—and they are valuable in identifying
and eliminating systematic effects. Roughly equal numbers of blocks
are taken in all eight of the manual states. When we divide the data
according to these manual-reversal states and analyse each data set
separately, the EDMs obtained are consistent with one another, as
shown in Fig. 5. We also divide the data according to the polarization
angles of the pump and probe and find no correlation with either.

Combining the systematic uncertainties in quadrature yields the
final result de 5 (22.4 6 5.7stat 6 1.5syst) 3 10228e cm, where the first
uncertainty is statistical (68% symmetric confidence interval23) and the
second systematic. This is consistent with zero and with the previous
best measurement7. The result is 54 times more precise than our pre-
vious measurement8. Treating the statistical and systematic errors on
equal terms, we can extract an upper bound on the size of the EDM of
jdej , 10.5 3 10228e cm with 90% confidence. This is 1.5 times smaller
than the previous upper limit7.

Our error is dominated by the statistical uncertainty of the measure-
ment. The limiting systematic errors in the measurement are sufficiently
well understood that we can readily reduce them to the 10229e cm range.
Our experiment leads the way in the application of cold molecule
techniques to precision measurement and we are well placed to take
advantage of recent advances in the preparation24–26 and control27 of
cold molecules to improve our measurement precision. This will allow
us to probe for new particle physics at tens of tera-electronvolts.

METHODS SUMMARY
Pulses of YbF are emitted by the source17 every 40 ms and travel through the
magnetically shielded apparatus (Fig. 1) at a speed of 590 m s21. The pump
detector depletes and detects the F 5 1 population while the probe detector mea-
sures the F 5 0 population. Two r.f. p-pulses, separated by the free-evolution time
T, and tuned to the Stark-shifted hyperfine interval near 170 MHz, coherently
transfer molecules between the F 5 0 and F 5 1 states. The primary signal is the
detected F 5 0 population, which is proportional to cos2w. The electron EDM is
obtained from the part of w that correlates with the sign of E, which in turn is
obtained from the signal correlating with the sign of E?B.

To measure this correlation, and a rich set of other signal correlations, the
machine is put into a new state between each beam pulse. There are nine switched
parameters, and hence 512 different switch combinations; each is set eight times in
every data block (a group of 4,096 pulses). For each block, the switching sequence
is chosen at random from a set of possible sequences; all of these switch B fre-
quently to eliminate magnetic field noise, switch E infrequently to minimize the
dead time associated with this switch, and switch E?B aperiodically to eliminate
signal drifts from this channel28. Between one block and the next, the relative phase
of the two r.f. pulses is randomly changed, the linear polarizations of pump and
probe are randomly rotated, and the central values of the magnetic field, the laser
frequency, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the two r.f. pulses, are adjusted
towards their ideal values.

METHODS
Apparatus. The apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. A solenoid valve opens every 40 ms
to release a pulse of Ar containing 2% SF6. Ytterbium atoms laser-ablated from a
target beside the valve react with the gas pulse to form YbF. The gas expands, cools
and is skimmed to form a beam with a temperature of 3 K and a centre-of-mass
velocity of 590 m s21 (ref. 17). The YbF molecules are mainly in the electronic and
vibrational ground state X2S1(v 5 0). Those in the rotational ground state are
distributed over the hyperfine levels F 5 0 and F 5 1, separated by 170.254 MHz. A
single-mode continuous-wave dye laser provides the linearly polarized pump and
probe beams shown in Fig. 1. The pump and probe are respectively tuned to the
F 5 1 and F 5 0 components of the A–X Q(0) transition, so that the pump empties
out the F 5 1 population and the probe measures the F 5 0 population by laser-
induced fluorescence detection. Each packet of molecules passing through the
probe beam generates a current pulse in the photomultiplier corresponding to
,5,000 detected photons. The current pulse is digitized in 80 bins over 800 ms to
produce signals such as that shown in Fig. 2. The pump fluorescence is recorded in
a similar way. We also record the intensities of both laser beams. The timing of the
experiment is phase-locked to the mains electrical supply.

The field plates are gold-coated cast aluminium, 75 cm long, 7 cm wide and
1.2 cm apart. The static electric and magnetic fields between these plates are typically
E 5 610 kV cm21 and B 5 613 nT. The plate structure doubles as a TEM (trans-
verse electromagnetic) transmission line to propagate 170 MHz radiation in either
direction. The r.f. pulses are designed to be p-pulses, so that the transfer of molecules
Þ state occurs with
i
iz 1,{1
between the jF, mFæ 5j0, 0æ state and the 1ﬃﬃ
p
unit efficiency. The first r.f. pulse is applied 1.1 ms after the ablation pulse, when the
molecules are approximately 13 cm inside the plates. The second r.f. pulse is applied
after the free evolution time of T 5 642 ms. Both pulses are 18-ms-long r.f. magnetic
field pulses polarized along ^x (Fig. 1). If the p-pulses are imperfect, coherence
between F 5 0 and F 5 1 states results in additional, unwanted interference terms.
We suppress these terms by averaging the relative r.f. phase w0 6 p/2 over the Wrf
switch and by randomizing w0 between blocks. The theory of two-pulse r.f. transi-
tions within this three-level manifold is developed fully in section IV.B of ref. 29.
The beam line is enclosed by two layers of magnetic shielding. The high-voltage
feeds pass close together through a single hole in the inner magnetic shield near the
centre of the plates to minimize shield magnetization by the charging currents. A
fluxgate magnetometer between the shields measures the magnetic field parallel to
^z near the probe detector. Three other magnetometers of lower sensitivity are used
to monitor the laboratory magnetic field—one near the beam machine, one close
to the high-voltage relays that reverse E, and one close to the computer interface
that controls the experiment. These are also read after every pulse and their
primary purpose is to ensure that E-reversal does not generate a magnetic field.
The same analogue–digital converter board that reads these signals also monitors
two dummy voltages, a battery and a short circuit. These are used to check that
there are no systematic errors in the signal processing electronics and data analysis.
Diagnostic data are also obtained from two ammeters22 that measure the cur-

by roughly 1% over the length of the plates, and that the ambient magnetic field is
typically less than 10 nT throughout the region that we use for the interferometer.
The r.f. field has a small standing-wave ratio, corresponding to a 4% power
reflection coefficient at each end. In the TEM mode, the r.f. electric field is con-
strained by the same boundary conditions as the static field, ensuring that the r.f.
magnetic field is accurately perpendicular to E and to the propagation direction.
The r.f. field at each end of the plates has some ellipticity, due to the transient
where the transmission line is coupled to coaxial cable. This decays away over a few
centimetres.
Switching sequence. As discussed in the main text, nine separate parameters are
switched in the experiment. A set of 4,096 beam pulses forms a block of data,
within which all 512 combinations of switch states are covered equally. The
sequence of switches applied within a block, known as the switching pattern, must
satisfy three requirements. First, the magnetic field should switch frequently to
eliminate magnetic field noise. Second, the electric field must switch less often
because E reversal incurs a dead time of 14 s. This allows time to discharge and
recharge the plates while keeping the transient currents below 5 mA to avoid
magnetizing the shields. By the time we restart data acquisition the current is close
to its steady value of ,1 nA. This restriction is important because a magnetic field
reversing with E can generate a systematic error. Third, the switching sequence of
E?B should be as aperiodic as possible so that signal drifts do not influence this
channel28. Within these restrictions, there are still a large number of possible
switching patterns from which the computer randomly chooses one at the start
of every block. At the end of each block the channel values are calculated and some
of these are used to optimize the running of the machine. For example, {B}
measures how well the operating fields are centred around B 5 0 and this provides
an error signal at the end of each block that is fed back to compensate for small
drifts of the ambient field. Similarly, {nrf1} and {nrf2} are used to lock the r.f.
frequencies to resonance while {arf1} and {arf2} are used to lock the r.f. amplitudes
to the p-pulse condition. The laser- frequency channel {LF} is used to keep the laser
on resonance. Between blocks the mean relative phase w0 between the two r.f.
pulses is randomly changed and the linear polarizations of the pump and probe
laser beams are randomly rotated. Including the dead time, each block takes
approximately 6 min to accumulate.
EDM interaction. The interaction of the electron in a molecule with an applied
electric field is more complicated than that of a free electron, described in the
introduction. It is possible however to write the interaction as 2d ? Eeff. The effective
electric field Eeff, which depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, accounts
for the complexity of the molecular environment. Under our operating conditions
the effective field has magnitude 14.5 GV cm21 and is aligned antiparallel to the
applied field10–15. Thus, the energy shift of the (F 5 1, mF) state of the molecule due to
the electron EDM is 2deEeffmF where Eeff 5 214.5 GV cm21. In deriving the EDM
we have assumed that the effective field is known exactly. Although there is some
uncertainty in the theoretical calculation, even an uncertainty of 10% would have no
impact on our error at the level reported here.

rents flowing to the electric field plates.
Characterizing the machine. We have mapped the spatial variation of the electric,
magnetic and r.f. fields, as described in ref. 16. We find that the electric field varies
