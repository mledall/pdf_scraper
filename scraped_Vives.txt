We prove that taking correctly into account the lepton ﬂavour dependence of the CP asymmetries and
washout processes, it is possible to obtain successful thermal leptogenesis from the decays of the second
right-handed neutrino. The asymmetries in the muon and tau-ﬂavour channels are then not erased by the
inverse decays of the lightest right-handed neutrino N1. In this way, we reopen the possibility of ‘‘thermal
leptogenesis’’ in models with a strong hierarchy in the right-handed Majorana masses that is typically the
case in models with up-quark neutrino-Yukawa uniﬁcation.

The measure of nonvanishing neutrino masses and mix-
ings and the use of the seesaw mechanism to explain the
smallness of these masses has made leptogenesis [1] one of
the most promising mechanisms to generate the observed
value of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. The see-
saw mechanism requires the presence of heavy right-
handed neutrinos with complex Yukawa couplings that
can generate a lepton asymmetry through their out-of-
equilibrium decays. This ‘‘lepton’’ asymmetry is then
transformed into baryon asymmetry by the standard model
sphaleron processes violating (B  L) [2]. When the right-
handed neutrinos are produced through scatterings (mainly
inverse decays) in the thermal plasma this scenario is
known as ‘‘thermal leptogenesis.’’

In the thermal leptogenesis mechanism, it is usually
assumed that the lepton asymmetry is generated by the
out-of-equilibrium decays of the lightest right-handed neu-
trino N1. The asymmetry generated by the two heavier
right-handed neutrinos N2 and N3 that we take as hierarchi-
cally heavier than N1, is usually assumed to be either
negligible or efﬁciently washed out by the N1 inverse
decays [3]. In these conditions only N1 generates a baryon
asymmetry. The ﬁnal value of the baryon asymmetry nor-
malized to the entropy density B is then related to the CP
asymmetry "1 in the decays of the lightest right-handed
neutrino as

However this lower bound represents a serious problem for
many ﬂavour models, specially those incorporating some
grand uniﬁcation symmetry. In these models we usually
expect that neutrino Yukawas are closely related to the up-
quark Yukawa matrices. As show in the appendix of [6]
(see also Ref. [7]) and explained below, in these models it
is possible to obtain the mass of the lightest right-handed

This implies that, barring accidental cancellations (or some
speciﬁc textures as in [8]), having a large enough N1 is only
possible if we have simultaneously m1 & 4  10ÿ6 eV,

8  10ÿ5 (for matm ’ 0:05 eV). These conditions are usu-
ally not satisﬁed in most ﬂavour models where the typical
values for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass are close
to 106–107 GeV with W12 of the order of mixing angle in
solar neutrinos [9–11]. Therefore, apparently, these mod-
els cannot produce a sufﬁcient baryon asymmetry through
the thermal leptogenesis mechanism.

and W2

It is evident that this represents a very serious problem
for all these ﬂavour models, that are forced to abandon
thermal leptogenesis and use other mechanisms to produce
the observed baryon asymmetry [12]. In this paper we
present a solution to this problem. We show that when
the ﬂavour dependence of the lepton asymmetries and the
erasure processes are correctly taken into account, it is still
possible to generate a large enough baryon asymmetry in
the decays of the second right-handed neutrino N2 that then
survives the washout due to the inverse decays of N1. The
basic idea behind this statement is that the asymmetries
generated by N2 in the different ﬂavour channels are
washed out by different N1 Yukawa interactions. In fact,
the decays of the second right-handed neutrino N2 create
different asymmetries in the , , and e channels. As we
will show these asymmetries do not mix through the ther-
mal interactions with the plasma before the N1 inverse
decays become effective. Therefore, it is evident that the
different ﬂavour channels will only be erased by the cor-
responding N1 ! HLi interaction and not by the sum over
all lepton ﬂavours as usually done [3,6,13–16]. Taking into
account these effects, we prove here that in models with
Y ’ Yu, the lepton asymmetry in the  and  channels is
only mildly erased by N1 decays. Some of these ideas were
already present in the literature. For instance, the possibil-
ity of generating the asymmetry in N2 decays was previ-
ously discussed by P. di Bari
in the one ﬂavour
approximation [13]; an early discussion of ﬂavour effects
in leptogenesis, mainly in N1 decays, can be found in [17],
and ﬂavour effects in the context of low scale leptogenesis
models were recently studied in [18]. In this paper we show
that combining these elements it is possible to obtain
successful
leptogenesis in realistic models of fermion
masses with up-quark neutrino-Yukawa uniﬁcation.
Therefore, we reopen the possibility of ‘‘thermal lepto-
genesis’’ in these models.

In the following we give a general proof of this state-
ment. Although this mechanism is equally valid in super-
symmetric and nonsupersymmetric models we only
discuss the nonsupersymmetric example. The supersym-
metric case is completely analogous [19].

Given the strong hierarchy in the neutrino-Yukawa eigen-
values (similar to the hierarchy in the up-quark masses) we
have in practice always that j ~1j2  j ~2j2, j ~3j2. For in-
stance, to change this hierarchy in the simpliﬁed case
where we take W13 ’ 0 and y1=y3 ’ 0 would require that
j11j < j22jy2

understand that the largest eigenvalue of the matrix ,

At this point we can already discuss the behavior of a

Owing to the hierarchy in the neutrino-Yukawa matrices
and the right-handed Majorana neutrinos, the ﬁrst term

values of this efﬁciency factor are model dependent and
therefore we keep this factor as a parameter in the
following.

At temperatures slightly below M2 we have three differ-
ent asymmetries in the , , and e channels. These
asymmetries remain basically unchanged from T  M2 to
T  M1 and, in particular, the different ﬂavours do not
mix. In fact, at this temperature, both N2 and N3 right-
handed neutrinos have already decayed. Therefore the only
possible Yukawa interactions in the plasma are those with
the right-handed charged leptons and with N1. Taking into
account that the Ye
3;3 Yukawa interactions are in thermal
equilibrium at temperatures below ’ 1014 GeV, it is more
convenient to use the basis of diagonal charged lepton
Yukawas to include these interactions in the thermal
masses. Thus, only the Yukawa interactions with N1 can
change ﬂavour, although N1 are very rare in the plasma up
to temperatures of the order of M1 when they reach the
equilibrium density [15,16]. Therefore, we have to discus
the washout of the different asymmetries by the N1 decays
and inverse decays. First, it is easy to see that this washout
will be exponential and not linear if the N1 are thermally
produced at temperatures close to M1. From Ref. [15] and
taking "1 ’ 0, the Boltzman equation for this case would
be [23]:

This could be possible in models based in Abelian ﬂavour
symmetries or discrete symmetries, although it is clear the
ﬁnal result is highly model dependent and the different
models must be studied in detail.

We have shown that taking correctly into account the
lepton ﬂavour dependence of the CP asymmetries and
washout processes, it is possible to obtain successful ther-
mal leptogenesis from the decays of the second right-
handed neutrino. The asymmetries in the muon and tau-
ﬂavour channels are then not erased by the inverse decays
of the lightest right-handed neutrino N1. Therefore ‘‘ther-
mal leptogenesis’’ is still viable in models with a strong
hierarchy in the right-handed Majorana masses that is
typically the case in models with up-quark neutrino-
Yukawa uniﬁcation.

[22] Strictly speaking we should include a 3  3 matrix A
connecting the lepton asymmetries in the different lepton
ﬂavours La to the a asymmetries [17]. However, at T >
109 GeV these constant matrices are very close to the
identity and their inclusion does not change the results
below.

[23] Notice that, due to the exponential washout, order one

factors in the A matrices can be important [17].
[24] In this equation we consider only the effects of decays and
inverse decays. The effects of L  1 and L  2 scat-

terings do not change the results presented here for ~ma
